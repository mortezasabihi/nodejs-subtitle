1
00:01:30,194 --> 00:01:31,737
Hey!

2
00:01:57,096 --> 00:02:00,659
...a dark
and stormy Halloween.

3
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:06,980
Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.

4
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:08,249
Our top story tonight,

5
00:02:08,273 --> 00:02:09,316
just-released polls

6
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:11,044
have incumbent
Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

7
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,962
and 28-year-old
grassroots challenger

8
00:02:12,986 --> 00:02:14,487
Bella Real in
a dead heat.

9
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:16,383
Things certainly
got hot last night

10
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:20,303
in their final debate before
next Tuesday's election.

11
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:21,680
Now, my young
opponent here

12
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:24,140
wants to gut
the Gotham Renewal Program,

13
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:26,017
established by
the great Thomas Wayne.

14
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,269
Cutting funds
from vital projects

15
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:29,187
like our seawall,

16
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:30,772
and the safety net
for those who need it.

17
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:32,190
The Renewal Program is broken.

18
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:34,818
This city's been renewing
for 20 years.

19
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:37,763
Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.

20
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:39,640
Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.

21
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:40,281
Now wait... Now hang on.

22
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:42,258
We have a masked vigilante
running the street.

23
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,401
Under my administration,

24
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,045
the Gotham PD
has dealt major blows

25
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,421
to organized crime
and drug trafficking.

26
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:48,506
The Salvatore Maroni case

27
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,382
was the biggest drug bust
in city history.

28
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:52,761
But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.

29
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:54,345
-It's gotten worse.
-I'm not saying...

30
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:55,764
I'm not saying
there isn't work to do.

31
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:56,973
But listen...

32
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:58,725
...I have a beautiful wife
and young son, okay?

33
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:00,876
And I will not rest...

34
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:05,524
Hey.

35
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,903
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

36
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,476
Why is she still tied?

37
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:20,163
But...

38
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:25,067
But I thought we were getting a
bump in the newPostpoll.

39
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:32,259
Okay, you know what?

40
00:03:32,283 --> 00:03:33,677
I can't...
I can't watch this anymore.

41
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,971
Just call me
in the morning, okay?

42
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:39,849
...who still believes

43
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:41,309
in everything
this city can do.

44
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,894
We need a leader,
Mr. Mitchell,

45
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:43,812
not a cheerleader.

46
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:46,982
And someone who will
tell the people the truth.

47
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:09,230
Thursday,
October 31st.

48
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:24,978
The city streets are
crowded for the holiday.

49
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:29,084
Even with the rain.

50
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:36,800
Hidden in the chaos
is the element

51
00:05:36,824 --> 00:05:39,785
waiting to strike like snakes.

52
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:42,788
But I'm there too.

53
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:45,541
Watching.

54
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,727
Two years of nights

55
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:51,505
have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.

56
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:59,680
I must choose
my targets carefully.

57
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:13,170
Come on!

58
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:14,463
- Give me the money.
- Okay.

59
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:17,174
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

60
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:19,533
It's a big city.

61
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:25,873
I can't be everywhere.

62
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,344
But they don't know
where I am.

63
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:45,268
Look at this guy, man.

64
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:53,025
- Boom!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

65
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:57,298
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

66
00:06:57,322 --> 00:06:59,865
Yo, let's see your hits.

67
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:02,076
That's you.

68
00:07:20,803 --> 00:07:26,434
We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.

69
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:30,372
But when that light
hits the sky,

70
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:33,274
it's not just a call.

71
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,402
It's a warning.

72
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:39,197
To them.

73
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:50,059
Fear...

74
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,213
...is a tool.

75
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:06,783
Are you
out of your mind?

76
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:09,477
Watch where you're goin',
drophead!

77
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:23,133
They think
I'm hiding in the shadows.

78
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,828
Come on!

79
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,131
But I
am the shadows.

80
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:57,334
Come on, come on.

81
00:08:57,358 --> 00:08:59,003
Whoo.

82
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:00,212
-Hey, go on, man! Go!
-Get him!

83
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,631
-Come on, man!
-What are you doin'?

84
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,383
Help!

85
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:06,242
Somebody help me!

86
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:09,037
Help, help!

87
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,353
Where you goin', huh?

88
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,594
-Come on.
-Come on, man. Break it.

89
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:27,739
You can't move, huh?

90
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:29,575
Now knock his ass out.

91
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,952
Showtime. Showtime, man.

92
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:32,995
Come on, man.

93
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,021
Come on. Do it, man.

94
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:12,183
You see this guy?

95
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:20,775
The hell are you
supposed to be?

96
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,085
I'm vengeance.

97
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,088
Holy shit. It's him.

98
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:09,157
Hey, man. No, no, no!

99
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:51,991
Please don't hurt me.

100
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,738
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

101
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:32,132
Police action.

102
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:34,618
He's with me, Officer.

103
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,388
Are you kidding me, sir?

104
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:40,974
You're gonna let him in here?

105
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:44,628
Martinez, let him through.

106
00:12:57,766 --> 00:13:00,143
Goddamn freak.

107
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:16,910
What do we know?

108
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,773
Detective?

109
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:30,525
Sorry, Lieutenant.

110
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:36,071
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

111
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:40,434
He got hit a lot of times.
And hard.

112
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,247
All this blood
is from his head?

113
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:46,690
No.

114
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:52,236
Excuse me.

115
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:56,408
Most of it's from his hand.

116
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,915
Thumb was severed.

117
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:05,727
Killer may have taken it
as a trophy.

118
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:09,003
He was alive
when it was cut off.

119
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:12,317
Ecchymosis

120
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:14,509
around the wound.

121
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,000
Security detail downstairs

122
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:33,737
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

123
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:37,449
The mayor was up here alone.

124
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:42,579
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

125
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:49,979
You said
there was a card.

126
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:52,381
Yeah.

127
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:05,560
"From your
secret friend. Whoo?

128
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:07,497
Haven't a clue?

129
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:10,875
Let's play a game,
just me and you.

130
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:14,611
What does a liar do
when he's dead?"

131
00:15:15,153 --> 00:15:18,031
There's a cipher too.

132
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:26,665
Any of this
mean anything to you?

133
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,419
What's going on here?

134
00:15:32,587 --> 00:15:33,982
I asked him to come, Pete.

135
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:35,858
This is a crime scene.

136
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:38,236
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

137
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,862
I got the press downstairs.

138
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:42,240
You know, I cut you
a lot of slack, Jim,

139
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:43,157
'cause we got history.

140
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:45,892
But this is way over the line.

141
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:49,664
Wait.

142
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:51,958
-He's involved in this?
-No, he's not involved.

143
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:52,667
How do you know?

144
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:55,461
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

145
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,088
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

146
00:15:57,112 --> 00:15:59,716
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

147
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,908
He lies still.

148
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:04,411
Excuse me?

149
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,347
The riddle.

150
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:09,225
What does a liar do
when he's dead?

151
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,044
He lies still.

152
00:16:19,593 --> 00:16:21,636
Oh, Jesus.

153
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:27,684
This must be your favorite
night of the year, huh, pal?

154
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:30,039
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

155
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:32,790
Excuse me,
Commissioner.

156
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:35,692
They're ready
for your statement.

157
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:41,448
I want him outta here.

158
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:43,158
Now!

159
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:50,958
Come on.

160
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:04,931
Yeah.

161
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:07,599
The kid found him.

162
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:12,830
Was there anyone else

163
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:15,607
in the house when you arrived?

164
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:34,209
We really gotta go, man.

165
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,236
Tonight,
a son lost a father.

166
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,888
A wife lost a husband.

167
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,199
And I lost a friend.

168
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:50,743
Mayor Mitchell was a fighter
for the city,

169
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:54,414
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

170
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:57,667
This was
a truly senseless crime,

171
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:58,836
and we are
actively pursuing

172
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,838
every investigative lead
we have

173
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:04,049
in order to identify
the perpetrator

174
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:05,466
and hunt him down.

175
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,467
I've spoken to the governor...

176
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:09,805
I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,

177
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,305
but I don't know.

178
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:19,773
Murder, robberies,
assault.

179
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:23,152
Two years later,
they're all up.

180
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:25,219
And now this.

181
00:18:26,428 --> 00:18:28,973
The city's eating itself.

182
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:32,935
Maybe it's beyond saving.

183
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:37,314
But I have to try.

184
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:39,483
Push myself.

185
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:28,241
These nights all roll
together in a rush,

186
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:31,118
behind the mask.

187
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:37,917
Sometimes in the morning,

188
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,837
I have to force myself
to remember

189
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,800
everything that happened.

190
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:00,373
Unbelievable breaking
news

191
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:01,332
this hour, everyone.

192
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:04,418
Again, four-term incumbentGotham
Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

193
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:07,421
was found murdered last night
inside his home

194
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:09,299
in the exclusive
Crest Hill district.

195
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:11,635
Exact
details of the crime

196
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:12,803
still have not
been released,

197
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:15,471
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway

198
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:18,850
as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.

199
00:20:18,874 --> 00:20:21,562
And this certainly
is not the first time

200
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:22,478
Gotham has been rocked

201
00:20:22,502 --> 00:20:23,939
by the murder
of a political figure.

202
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:26,066
In fact,
in an eerie coincidence,

203
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,859
it was 20 years
ago this week

204
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,570
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist

205
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:31,404
Dr. Thomas Wayne
and his wife Martha

206
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:35,158
were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.

207
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:36,118
It was a shocking crime

208
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:38,495
that remains unsolved
to this day.

209
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,289
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s
political career

210
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:43,709
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs

211
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:44,710
when he and city police

212
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:47,045
launched a major
sting operation

213
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:48,005
resulting in the arrest

214
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:51,091
of notorious mafia crime
figure Salvatore Maroni,

215
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:52,050
with what, to this day,

216
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:55,262
remains the biggest drug bust
in GCPD history.

217
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:56,346
I assume you heard about this.

218
00:20:58,455 --> 00:21:00,750
Yeah.

219
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:08,233
Oh, I see.

220
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:11,862
All this
blood is from his head?

221
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:13,554
Dear God.

222
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,357
There's a cipher too.

223
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:34,635
Any of this
mean anything to you?

224
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:39,622
The killer left this
for the Batman?

225
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,184
I asked
him to come, Pete.

226
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:42,893
Apparently.

227
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,961
You're becoming
quite a celebrity.

228
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:48,065
Why is he writing to you?

229
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,275
It's Mitchell,
for chrissakes!

230
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:51,026
I don't know yet.

231
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,552
I got the press
downstairs.

232
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:56,907
Have a shower.

233
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,201
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

234
00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:00,535
are coming for breakfast.

235
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,745
Here? Why?

236
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:03,163
Because I couldn't get you
to go there.

237
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:06,500
-I haven't got time for this.
-It's getting serious, Bruce.

238
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:07,335
If this continues,

239
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,628
it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

240
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:11,987
I don't care about that.

241
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:12,839
Any of that.

242
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:15,367
You don't care
about your family's legacy?

243
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:20,097
What I'm doing
is my family's legacy.

244
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:22,891
If I can't change things here,

245
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:25,560
if I can't have an effect,

246
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:27,688
then I don't care
what happens to me.

247
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:29,106
That's what I'm afraid of.

248
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,257
Alfred, stop.

249
00:22:31,882 --> 00:22:34,135
You're not my father.

250
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:38,348
I'm well aware.

251
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,884
We really gotta go, man.

252
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:42,287
Some fresh berries there.

253
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:49,437
What are you doing?

254
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:53,648
Just reminiscing about my days
in the Circus.

255
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:58,928
This is
actually quite elusive.

256
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:02,824
Where'd you get those O's?

257
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:06,787
"He lies still"
is only a partial key.

258
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,997
It only gives us
H, E, L, I, S, and T.

259
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:12,876
So, I'm looking for
any double symbols to start,

260
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,002
trying letters,

261
00:24:14,026 --> 00:24:16,028
see where it leads.

262
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,906
That's interesting.

263
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:21,135
Mr. Pennyworth?

264
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,178
Yes, Dory?

265
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:23,637
The accountants are here.

266
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:26,373
See them in, please, Dory.

267
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:31,019
What if
it's not a partial key?

268
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:32,313
What do you mean?

269
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,524
What if this is the whole key?

270
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:37,235
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

271
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:38,693
Use only the letters
from "He lies still"

272
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:40,530
-and leave the rest...
-Blank. Yeah, I understand.

273
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:43,074
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

274
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:45,159
I don't see
how that's gonna...

275
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:49,563
Oh.

276
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:04,095
Damn.

277
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:07,223
Yeah, he's got a car.

278
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:10,017
Guess it's good
to be the mayor.

279
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,269
Where to even start?

280
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:14,813
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

281
00:25:14,837 --> 00:25:16,524
You don't trust me?

282
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,401
You mean like you trust me?

283
00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:19,277
It's been two years now,

284
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:22,053
and I don't even know
who you are, man.

285
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:25,056
There.

286
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:49,557
What are we looking for?

287
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,350
A USB port.

288
00:25:51,374 --> 00:25:52,435
USB?

289
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:01,176
What?

290
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,807
"Thumb" drive.

291
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:11,227
Jesus.

292
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:16,358
It's encrypted.

293
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,071
Try this.

294
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:30,413
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

295
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,400
Oh, well, well, well.

296
00:26:41,424 --> 00:26:44,111
So much for family values.

297
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,613
Who is she?

298
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:46,822
No idea.

299
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:50,284
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

300
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,954
I know who he is.

301
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,604
What was that?

302
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:58,709
Shit, shit, shit! The drive.

303
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:01,003
It sent out the photos
from my account.

304
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:04,632
Gotham Post, Gazette,
GC-1, all of them.

305
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:05,424
Jesus.

306
00:27:05,448 --> 00:27:09,053
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

307
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:10,680
"He lies still."

308
00:27:10,704 --> 00:27:12,288
About her?

309
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,392
Maybe.

310
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,601
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

311
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:19,480
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

312
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,882
Never get in there
without a warrant.

313
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,302
Yeah.

314
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:40,608
Know who I am?

315
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,755
Yeah. I got an idea.

316
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,423
I want to see the Penguin.

317
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:49,034
I don't know what
you're talking about, pal.

318
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:54,473
What's the problem?

319
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:56,017
Says he wants
to see the Penguin.

320
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,019
Penguin?
There's no Penguin here.

321
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,645
That's what
I tried to tell him.

322
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,732
Get out of here, freak.
You hear me?

323
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:05,175
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

324
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:07,635
Mine or yours?

325
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,037
Get him!

326
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,455
I saw that whole thing.

327
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:18,581
He's over there!

328
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:20,899
What is your problem?

329
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,278
Yo!

330
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:05,694
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

331
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,972
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

332
00:29:16,996 --> 00:29:19,225
Take it easy, sweetheart.

333
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:21,728
You looking for me?

334
00:29:21,752 --> 00:29:23,855
I see you met the twins.

335
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:28,676
Boy, you're everything
they say, ain't ya?

336
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,052
I guess we both are.

337
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,616
How you doing?

338
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,909
I'm Oz.

339
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:42,499
Who is she?

340
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,629
I really don't know, chief.

341
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:50,923
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

342
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,424
but I wasn't rolling
with them.

343
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:06,606
It's okay, baby.

344
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,802
Mr. Vengeance here,
he don't bite. Come on.

345
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,137
Thank you, honey.

346
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,354
Here you go, champ.

347
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:47,856
I wanna know who she is,

348
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,774
and what she has to do
with this murder.

349
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:52,318
-Whose murder?
-The mayor's.

350
00:30:52,343 --> 00:30:53,528
Is that the mayor?

351
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,304
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

352
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,616
Don't make me hurt you.

353
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,370
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

354
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:06,105
Yeah, I do. Do you?

355
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:09,360
Look...

356
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:13,298
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

357
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:15,508
I mean, what people do here

358
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:18,535
ain't got nothing to do
with me.

359
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,420
Tell you one thing.

360
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:33,610
Whoever she is,
she's one hot chick.

361
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:35,570
Why don't you ask
Mitchell's wife?

362
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,178
Maybe she knows.

363
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,225
What? Too soon?

364
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:54,129
You let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

365
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,748
Taxi!

366
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,252
Taxi!

367
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:27,121
Hey, it's me.

368
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:29,833
Baby, what's wrong?

369
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:33,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down,
slow down. I can't...

370
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,798
On the news?

371
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:40,343
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

372
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:42,262
Wait for me,
I'm on my way home.

373
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:44,472
Listen, baby,

374
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:47,183
we're gonna get the hell
out of here, okay? I promise.

375
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:51,062
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

376
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:53,213
Uh...

377
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:56,967
God damn it.

378
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:16,546
...photos
of murdered mayor,

379
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,924
Don Mitchell, Jr. with
a younger mystery woman.

380
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:21,009
In a shocking
development,

381
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,677
the police believe
the photos themselves...

382
00:33:55,818 --> 00:34:00,156
Now they urge her
to contact the GCPD...

383
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,084
You're pretty good at that.

384
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:49,575
Hey! Give me that.

385
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:55,266
"Kosolov, Annika."

386
00:36:55,915 --> 00:36:57,977
He hurt her?
That's why you killed him?

387
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:01,437
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

388
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:41,687
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

389
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:44,273
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

390
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:45,774
She's trying to get
the hell out of here,

391
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:48,319
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

392
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:49,194
What does she know?

393
00:37:49,218 --> 00:37:50,738
Whatever it is,
it's got her so spooked

394
00:37:50,762 --> 00:37:51,989
she won't even tell me.

395
00:37:52,013 --> 00:37:54,223
She did seem upset.

396
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:57,518
Back at your place.

397
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,064
Let's go talk to her.

398
00:38:26,756 --> 00:38:28,299
Anni!

399
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:30,677
Baby!

400
00:38:31,803 --> 00:38:33,346
Anni!

401
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:39,102
Anni!

402
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,288
It's gonna
be cool this evening.

403
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:43,874
It's gonna be down
into the 40s.

404
00:38:43,898 --> 00:38:45,417
More
breaking news this hour,

405
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:49,963
as the city is rocked by a
second high-profile murder

406
00:38:49,987 --> 00:38:50,881
in as many nights.

407
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:52,591
And this time, the killer
has come forward

408
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:53,676
to claim credit online...

409
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,552
Jesus, what are they
gonna do to her?

410
00:38:55,576 --> 00:38:57,454
She's just a kid.

411
00:38:58,371 --> 00:39:00,182
- Shit, they took my phone.
- -His victim,

412
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:01,642
longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,

413
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:02,976
Commissioner Pete Savage,

414
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,728
was found dead
earlier tonight

415
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:07,356
inside the Police
Athletic League facilities

416
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,273
in the Tricorner area.

417
00:39:08,297 --> 00:39:11,193
The killer posted
the following message

418
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:12,069
on social media,

419
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:14,822
and we have to warn you, the
video is very disturbing.

420
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:22,746
Hello, people of Gotham.

421
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,773
This is the
Riddler speaking.

422
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:28,127
On Halloween night,

423
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:29,086
I killed your mayor

424
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:33,215
because he was not
who he pretended to be.

425
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,884
But I am not done.

426
00:39:38,244 --> 00:39:40,681
Here is another...

427
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,771
...who will soon
be losing face.

428
00:39:48,588 --> 00:39:53,152
I will kill again,
and again, and again

429
00:39:53,176 --> 00:39:54,236
until our day of judgment

430
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:00,826
when the truth about our city
will finally

431
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,853
be unmasked.

432
00:40:04,854 --> 00:40:06,291
Goodbye!

433
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:11,545
Commissioner Savage
served

434
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:14,173
a distinguished 30-year
career on the GCPD...

435
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:17,575
Holy shit,
I seen that guy, too.

436
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:20,244
At the club.

437
00:40:20,828 --> 00:40:22,997
The Iceberg Lounge?

438
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,208
44 Below.

439
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:28,127
What is that?

440
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:32,924
The club within the club.

441
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,927
The real club.

442
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:39,573
It's a mob hangout.

443
00:40:39,597 --> 00:40:41,326
Is that where you work?

444
00:40:43,684 --> 00:40:45,186
Selina?

445
00:40:49,483 --> 00:40:52,486
No, I just work
the bar upstairs.

446
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:57,132
But I see 'em come in.

447
00:40:57,156 --> 00:40:58,008
Who?

448
00:40:58,032 --> 00:40:59,552
A lot of guys
that shouldn't be there,

449
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:01,661
I can tell you that.

450
00:41:02,246 --> 00:41:06,082
Your basic
upstanding citizen types.

451
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:09,937
You're gonna help me on this.

452
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:12,046
For your friend.

453
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:23,975
You got a lot of cats.

454
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,455
I have a thing about strays.

455
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:32,859
You're not safe here.

456
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,086
I can take care of myself.

457
00:41:34,111 --> 00:41:35,255
Two
public figures

458
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:36,797
now dead in just
the last two nights,

459
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:38,757
and only days
before the election.

460
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:39,842
Police and city officials

461
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:41,635
are left searching
for a killer

462
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:46,038
and hoping to find him
before he kills again.

463
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,827
He waited for him at the gym.

464
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:09,414
Pete always liked
to work out late at night,

465
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:12,333
when no one else was around.

466
00:42:12,357 --> 00:42:14,168
There's a needle mark
on his neck.

467
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:17,029
Injected him with arsenic.

468
00:42:18,447 --> 00:42:20,365
Rat poison.

469
00:42:20,698 --> 00:42:21,800
Yeah.

470
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:25,138
That seems to be
his theme here.

471
00:42:25,162 --> 00:42:26,514
Look at this thing.

472
00:42:34,795 --> 00:42:36,399
It's a maze.

473
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:40,612
What kind of demented
son of a bitch

474
00:42:40,636 --> 00:42:43,013
does this to a person?

475
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:46,849
More symbols.

476
00:42:48,602 --> 00:42:49,454
It's another cipher.

477
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:53,082
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

478
00:42:53,106 --> 00:42:55,876
Bastard murders you
and your reputation.

479
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,238
That guy pushes drops.
On the east end.

480
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:01,924
I don't get it.

481
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:05,619
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

482
00:43:05,743 --> 00:43:07,888
Looks like he got greedy.

483
00:43:07,912 --> 00:43:08,681
You kidding me?

484
00:43:08,705 --> 00:43:11,351
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

485
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:12,685
We busted
their entire operation,

486
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:14,895
then he caves
to some lowlife dealer?

487
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,048
Maybe he's not
who you thought.

488
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,635
You make it sound
like he had it coming.

489
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:25,347
He was a cop.

490
00:43:26,014 --> 00:43:27,975
Crossed a line.

491
00:43:58,422 --> 00:43:59,399
"I'm mad about you.

492
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:04,594
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

493
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:13,371
"Follow the maze
until you find the rat.

494
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:18,001
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

495
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:19,669
The hell is that?

496
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:24,281
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

497
00:44:24,782 --> 00:44:26,968
I don't know.

498
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:28,261
Lieutenant.

499
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:29,262
They're coming back.

500
00:44:29,286 --> 00:44:31,264
We got
to get out of here.

501
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:37,335
Come on.

502
00:44:41,923 --> 00:44:43,508
Ow.

503
00:44:43,842 --> 00:44:45,111
I don't know
about these things.

504
00:44:45,135 --> 00:44:49,807
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

505
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:56,480
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

506
00:44:57,439 --> 00:44:59,817
I'm just looking for Annika.

507
00:45:03,111 --> 00:45:05,465
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

508
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:07,383
You really don't care
what happens to me

509
00:45:07,407 --> 00:45:09,367
in there tonight, do you?

510
00:45:18,418 --> 00:45:20,212
Look at me.

511
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:32,015
Looks good. Here.

512
00:46:14,224 --> 00:46:17,144
I got you. Can you hear me?

513
00:46:17,645 --> 00:46:19,104
Yeah.

514
00:46:26,945 --> 00:46:28,757
Hey, where you goin'?

515
00:46:28,781 --> 00:46:30,174
Hospitality.

516
00:46:30,198 --> 00:46:31,342
That's
one of the guys

517
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:34,077
I got into it with
the other night.

518
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:36,682
Looks like I
broke his nose.

519
00:46:43,336 --> 00:46:45,398
"Kenzie, William."

520
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:47,675
He's an off-duty cop.

521
00:46:48,049 --> 00:46:50,571
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

522
00:46:50,595 --> 00:46:53,598
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

523
00:47:08,946 --> 00:47:12,967
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

524
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:14,451
Great.

525
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:21,935
These guys
have a little problem

526
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:23,352
with eye contact, don't they?

527
00:47:23,376 --> 00:47:24,688
Feels good, doesn't it?

528
00:47:24,712 --> 00:47:27,965
Yeah, baby.
Feels real good.

529
00:47:32,678 --> 00:47:35,114
Jesus,
I hate dropheads.

530
00:47:35,138 --> 00:47:35,908
Really?

531
00:47:35,932 --> 00:47:36,950
'Cause when I first saw you,

532
00:47:36,974 --> 00:47:38,493
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

533
00:47:38,517 --> 00:47:39,953
You don't know
what you're talking about.

534
00:47:39,977 --> 00:47:41,078
Can we not...

535
00:47:41,102 --> 00:47:43,814
Can we not do this right now?

536
00:47:44,982 --> 00:47:46,835
Wait. Who was that?

537
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:47,753
Oh, I saw him.

538
00:47:47,777 --> 00:47:48,670
Look back.

539
00:47:48,694 --> 00:47:50,881
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

540
00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:52,949
I need to see his face.

541
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,076
Jesus.

542
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:04,645
That's the DA.

543
00:48:04,669 --> 00:48:05,437
Gil Colson.

544
00:48:05,461 --> 00:48:07,439
And he's coming over.
You happy?

545
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:09,423
Talk to him.

546
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:12,986
Hey. How you doing?

547
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,721
-Hi.
-I'm Gil.

548
00:48:15,888 --> 00:48:18,492
-Hey, aren't you the DA?
-Yeah.

549
00:48:18,516 --> 00:48:21,411
Wow.
I've seen you on TV.

550
00:48:21,435 --> 00:48:22,537
Is that right?

551
00:48:22,561 --> 00:48:25,707
I haven't seen you
around here before.

552
00:48:25,731 --> 00:48:27,918
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl

553
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:30,294
'cause people
are all a little on edge.

554
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,964
Oh, honey,
I live on the edge.

555
00:48:31,988 --> 00:48:33,757
Is that right?

556
00:48:33,781 --> 00:48:35,425
I
like that.

557
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:37,010
Do you want to come over?

558
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:38,494
Sure.

559
00:48:40,245 --> 00:48:41,598
- This is Travis.
- Hey.

560
00:48:41,622 --> 00:48:43,433
You wanna take a seat
over there?

561
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:46,502
- Richie, Glen.
- Hey.

562
00:48:47,044 --> 00:48:48,438
That's half the DA's office.

563
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:49,690
You know
Carla here, huh?

564
00:48:49,714 --> 00:48:51,733
-Hi.
-That's Cheri. Don't mind her,

565
00:48:51,757 --> 00:48:53,150
she's just taking a break.

566
00:48:53,174 --> 00:48:55,404
Drowning our sorrows.

567
00:48:55,428 --> 00:48:56,280
You want a drop?

568
00:48:56,304 --> 00:48:58,699
Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.

569
00:49:00,725 --> 00:49:02,159
Hope you don't mind.

570
00:49:02,183 --> 00:49:03,287
I got a lot on
my shoulders

571
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:05,162
with that psycho
running around.

572
00:49:05,186 --> 00:49:06,415
He's wasted.

573
00:49:06,439 --> 00:49:07,541
No shit.

574
00:49:07,565 --> 00:49:10,209
I
like this girl.

575
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:12,570
Oh, hey, I like you, too!

576
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:16,215
I mean, this Riddler,

577
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,719
he's going after the most
powerful people in the city.

578
00:49:18,743 --> 00:49:19,636
He knows so much.

579
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,054
He doesn't
know shit, man.

580
00:49:21,078 --> 00:49:22,431
What are you
talking about?

581
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:23,807
Yeah, he does!
What about that rat...

582
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:25,267
Hey, hey,
Gil, come on.

583
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:26,893
Hey. The rat. -Think
maybe you had

584
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:29,378
-a little too much. Slow down.
-Ask him about the rat.

585
00:49:29,962 --> 00:49:33,215
Hey,
what's this about a rat?

586
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:44,160
I mean,

587
00:49:44,185 --> 00:49:48,081
there was a rat.
We had an informant.

588
00:49:48,105 --> 00:49:50,584
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.

589
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:52,878
That's how we got him out of
the drops business.

590
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:54,212
He's talking about
the Maroni case.

591
00:49:54,236 --> 00:49:58,675
But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.

592
00:49:58,699 --> 00:49:59,593
And when it does,

593
00:49:59,617 --> 00:50:01,135
this whole city's
gonna come apart.

594
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,763
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

595
00:50:02,787 --> 00:50:04,056
This is
the kind of pillow talk

596
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,849
that got that Russian girl
disappeared.

597
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:07,809
What do you know about that?

598
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:11,271
- Does anybody want a drink?
- I want a drink.

599
00:50:11,295 --> 00:50:13,172
Keep him talking.

600
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:17,778
-Wait, where are you going?
-She knows Annika.

601
00:50:17,802 --> 00:50:18,779
No, stay on the DA.

602
00:50:18,803 --> 00:50:21,972
I told you
I'm looking for my friend.

603
00:50:23,265 --> 00:50:24,034
Where's Annika?

604
00:50:24,058 --> 00:50:25,285
Out of my face.
I don't know you.

605
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:26,703
Yeah, but you know her.
Who took her?

606
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:27,996
What have you heard?
Is she okay?

607
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,539
Jesus Christ,
keep your voice down.

608
00:50:29,563 --> 00:50:30,665
What, you got
a death wish?

609
00:50:30,689 --> 00:50:32,417
Hey,
what's the problem, ladies?

610
00:50:32,441 --> 00:50:35,295
There's no problem.
It's just girl talk.

611
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:37,547
Let's keep it festive
down here, all right?

612
00:50:37,571 --> 00:50:39,573
Sure thing, Oz.

613
00:50:43,828 --> 00:50:45,371
Hey.

614
00:50:45,538 --> 00:50:46,848
Hey.

615
00:50:46,872 --> 00:50:51,377
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

616
00:50:52,045 --> 00:50:53,879
How you been?

617
00:50:55,423 --> 00:50:57,925
Yeah, I've been okay.

618
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,636
I was just, um...

619
00:51:01,595 --> 00:51:04,075
I was just headed back
upstairs.

620
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:06,267
Mm. Well,

621
00:51:06,517 --> 00:51:09,020
don't be a stranger.

622
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:24,053
-You know Carmine Falcone.
-I told you it's a mob spot.

623
00:51:24,077 --> 00:51:25,637
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

624
00:51:25,661 --> 00:51:27,889
I don't have a relationship
with him, okay?

625
00:51:27,913 --> 00:51:29,183
Well, that's not
what it looked like.

626
00:51:29,207 --> 00:51:30,684
-Forget it.
-Wait, what are you doing?

627
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:32,894
Listen,
I can't do this anymore.

628
00:51:32,918 --> 00:51:33,687
No! No!

629
00:51:38,549 --> 00:51:39,609
Taxi!

630
00:51:43,596 --> 00:51:45,140
Hey!

631
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:47,367
I lost you in there.

632
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:49,102
Yeah, I gotta go.

633
00:51:49,227 --> 00:51:51,288
Oh, you need a ride?

634
00:51:51,312 --> 00:51:52,664
That's me right there.

635
00:51:58,987 --> 00:52:00,131
Taxi!

636
00:52:00,155 --> 00:52:01,739
I'm good.

637
00:52:03,074 --> 00:52:05,118
I hope, uh...

638
00:52:08,537 --> 00:52:11,290
I'll see you around.

639
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:40,314
Just hold still.

640
00:54:38,146 --> 00:54:40,958
What do you know
about a confidential informant

641
00:54:40,982 --> 00:54:43,026
in the Maroni case?

642
00:54:45,654 --> 00:54:47,673
Yeah, sure, there was.

643
00:54:47,697 --> 00:54:50,508
That's the rat
we're looking for.

644
00:54:50,532 --> 00:54:52,552
Somehow
Riddler knows who he is.

645
00:54:52,576 --> 00:54:56,307
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

646
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:57,432
Where are you getting this?

647
00:54:57,456 --> 00:55:01,543
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

648
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,105
Gil's very nervous.

649
00:55:03,129 --> 00:55:06,651
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

650
00:55:06,675 --> 00:55:08,110
I worked that case.

651
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:11,947
-Riddler's not after you.
-How do you know?

652
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:14,140
You're not corrupt.

653
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:16,726
Colson's dirty?

654
00:55:21,981 --> 00:55:23,250
Maybe I, uh...

655
00:55:23,274 --> 00:55:27,380
I go after him. Lean on him
to give up the rat.

656
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:28,297
It's too dangerous.

657
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:30,966
They made a secret deal
with this guy.

658
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,927
Who knows how many people
it touches.

659
00:55:32,951 --> 00:55:37,306
Politicians. Police.
The courts.

660
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:39,392
It could tear
the whole city apart.

661
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:42,752
Jesus,
this is a powder keg.

662
00:55:43,378 --> 00:55:45,564
And Riddler's the match.

663
00:55:45,588 --> 00:55:47,108
You know Carmine Falcone.

664
00:55:47,132 --> 00:55:48,609
I told you
it's a mob spot.

665
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:50,611
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

666
00:55:50,635 --> 00:55:52,196
I don't have
a relationship...

667
00:55:53,012 --> 00:55:54,990
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

668
00:55:55,014 --> 00:55:56,701
I don't have
a relationship with him.

669
00:55:56,725 --> 00:55:57,702
Okay?

670
00:55:57,726 --> 00:55:59,078
You know
Carmine Falcone.

671
00:55:59,102 --> 00:56:00,579
I told you
it's a mob spot.

672
00:56:00,603 --> 00:56:02,581
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

673
00:56:02,605 --> 00:56:04,500
I don't have a relationship with him.
 Okay?

674
00:56:04,524 --> 00:56:06,485
Pretty.

675
00:56:06,818 --> 00:56:09,696
She a new friend of yours?

676
00:56:13,032 --> 00:56:14,844
I'm not so sure.

677
00:56:14,868 --> 00:56:17,179
Looks like you upset her.

678
00:56:17,203 --> 00:56:19,765
Shall I take this
as a good sign?

679
00:56:19,789 --> 00:56:21,350
-What?
-Your attire.

680
00:56:21,374 --> 00:56:23,437
Is Bruce Wayne
making an actual appearance?

681
00:56:23,461 --> 00:56:25,229
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

682
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:29,443
Serial killers like to follow
reactions to their crimes.

683
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:31,527
Riddler might not
be able to resist.

684
00:56:31,551 --> 00:56:33,488
Oh, that reminds me.

685
00:56:33,512 --> 00:56:36,782
I've taken the liberty
of doing a little work

686
00:56:36,806 --> 00:56:38,534
on this latest cipher.

687
00:56:38,558 --> 00:56:40,035
The one from the rat maze.

688
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:43,372
I'm afraid his Spanish
is not perfect,

689
00:56:43,397 --> 00:56:45,833
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

690
00:56:45,857 --> 00:56:49,712
"You areEl Rata Alada."

691
00:56:49,736 --> 00:56:51,547
Rata Alada?

692
00:56:51,571 --> 00:56:52,590
"Rat with wings"?

693
00:56:52,614 --> 00:56:53,467
It's slang for "pigeon."

694
00:56:53,491 --> 00:56:55,593
Does that mean anything
to you?

695
00:56:55,617 --> 00:56:57,202
Yeah.

696
00:56:57,994 --> 00:56:58,763
A stool pigeon.

697
00:56:58,787 --> 00:57:02,707
-Where are your cufflinks?
-I couldn't find them.

698
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:04,935
Well, you can't
go out like that.

699
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:08,004
Alfred, I don't want
your cufflinks.

700
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:13,110
You have to keep up
appearances.

701
00:57:13,134 --> 00:57:15,489
You're still a Wayne.

702
00:57:15,513 --> 00:57:18,949
And what about you?
Are you a Wayne?

703
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:21,684
Your father gave them to me.

704
00:57:25,897 --> 00:57:30,504
No more lies! No more lies!

705
00:57:30,528 --> 00:57:33,839
No more lies! No more lies!

706
00:57:33,863 --> 00:57:37,302
No more lies! No more lies!

707
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:40,846
No more lies! No more lies!

708
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,016
No more lies! No more lies!

709
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,895
No more lies! No more lies!

710
00:57:47,919 --> 00:57:48,813
Mr. Wayne. All right.

711
00:57:48,837 --> 00:57:51,607
All right, you're going
straight down there.

712
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:04,620
Is that Bruce Wayne?

713
00:58:04,644 --> 00:58:07,206
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

714
00:58:17,115 --> 00:58:18,741
Hold it.

715
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:21,328
You good, fellas?

716
00:58:21,453 --> 00:58:22,912
Good.

717
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,124
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

718
00:58:43,517 --> 00:58:44,934
Sir?

719
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:04,556
Hey!

720
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,625
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

721
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:09,603
Hey, watch it, fellas.

722
00:59:09,627 --> 00:59:13,172
You got the prince
of the city there.

723
00:59:15,715 --> 00:59:16,942
Some event, huh?

724
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:19,154
Brought out the one guy
in the city

725
00:59:19,178 --> 00:59:20,113
more reclusive than me.

726
00:59:20,137 --> 00:59:22,449
Thought you'd never leave
the Shoreline.

727
00:59:22,473 --> 00:59:24,200
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

728
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:27,579
Why? 'Cause your father
ain't around?

729
00:59:27,603 --> 00:59:29,623
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

730
00:59:29,647 --> 00:59:31,291
Wow, is that right?

731
00:59:31,315 --> 00:59:33,792
His father saved my life.

732
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:38,155
I got shot in the chest.
Right here.

733
00:59:38,405 --> 00:59:39,674
I couldn't go to no hospital,

734
00:59:39,698 --> 00:59:41,884
so we showed up
on his doorstep.

735
00:59:41,908 --> 00:59:45,305
Operated right
on the dining room table.

736
00:59:45,329 --> 00:59:48,683
Kid here,
he saw the whole thing,

737
00:59:48,707 --> 00:59:51,710
up on the stairs looking down.

738
00:59:52,336 --> 00:59:55,130
I remember your face.

739
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:58,234
You don't think that meant
something, he did that?

740
00:59:58,258 --> 01:00:01,595
It meant he took
the Hippocratic oath.

741
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:04,515
"Hippocratic oath."

742
01:00:06,475 --> 01:00:08,244
That's good.

743
01:00:08,268 --> 01:00:09,978
Excuse me.

744
01:00:13,107 --> 01:00:13,708
Yes.

745
01:00:27,246 --> 01:00:28,764
Ladies and gentlemen,

746
01:00:28,788 --> 01:00:30,475
thank you all for coming
to today's memorial

747
01:00:30,499 --> 01:00:32,477
for our beloved mayor,
Don Mitchell, Jr.

748
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:34,521
Our program
will begin shortly.

749
01:00:34,545 --> 01:00:35,854
As a reminder,
the family asked

750
01:00:35,878 --> 01:00:37,607
that those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory

751
01:00:37,631 --> 01:00:39,234
consider a donation
to the cause

752
01:00:39,258 --> 01:00:41,444
most dear to his heart...

753
01:00:41,468 --> 01:00:43,779
...the Gotham
Renewal Fund,

754
01:00:43,803 --> 01:00:44,863
our city's safety net.

755
01:00:44,887 --> 01:00:48,451
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

756
01:00:48,475 --> 01:00:51,579
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it,

757
01:00:51,603 --> 01:00:52,622
I can tell you that.

758
01:00:52,646 --> 01:00:56,942
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

759
01:00:57,192 --> 01:00:59,819
He got what he deserved.

760
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:02,698
Know what I mean?

761
01:01:03,198 --> 01:01:05,427
Hey, don't I know you?

762
01:01:05,451 --> 01:01:07,012
Bruce Wayne.

763
01:01:07,036 --> 01:01:09,681
Why haven't
you called me back?

764
01:01:09,705 --> 01:01:10,348
I'm sorry?

765
01:01:10,372 --> 01:01:12,892
I'm Bella Real.
I'm running for mayor.

766
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:14,144
I wouldn't be bothering
you here,

767
01:01:14,168 --> 01:01:17,188
but your people keep
telling me you're unavailable.

768
01:01:17,212 --> 01:01:19,339
Will you walk with me?

769
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:25,363
Mr. Wayne.

770
01:01:25,387 --> 01:01:26,239
Mr. Wayne.

771
01:01:26,263 --> 01:01:30,118
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

772
01:01:30,142 --> 01:01:31,786
Your family
has a history of philanthropy,

773
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:34,622
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

774
01:01:34,646 --> 01:01:38,418
If I'm elected,
I want to change that.

775
01:01:38,442 --> 01:01:40,277
Thank you.

776
01:01:40,486 --> 01:01:42,154
My God.

777
01:01:42,362 --> 01:01:45,759
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

778
01:01:45,783 --> 01:01:48,077
I want to continue this.

779
01:01:51,705 --> 01:01:53,248
Excuse me.

780
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:57,169
I'm so sorry for your loss.

781
01:01:58,754 --> 01:01:59,397
Thank you.

782
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:02,132
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

783
01:02:02,674 --> 01:02:04,779
Gil Colson is missing.

784
01:02:04,803 --> 01:02:05,528
What?

785
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:08,448
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

786
01:02:08,472 --> 01:02:09,616
Christ, not again.

787
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,392
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

788
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:15,831
You got people
looking for him, Jim?

789
01:02:15,855 --> 01:02:18,500
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

790
01:02:18,524 --> 01:02:19,794
What'd his wife say?

791
01:02:19,818 --> 01:02:21,985
She hadn't
heard from him.

792
01:03:15,998 --> 01:03:17,225
Get out of the car!

793
01:03:17,249 --> 01:03:20,753
Get out of the car
and show your hands!

794
01:03:21,921 --> 01:03:23,505
Get out!

795
01:03:33,098 --> 01:03:34,325
Get 'em up!

796
01:03:34,349 --> 01:03:36,411
Get out! Show 'em!

797
01:03:40,522 --> 01:03:41,750
Christ, it's Colson.

798
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:44,359
There's a bomb
around his neck!

799
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:00,059
Let's clear
this place out now!

800
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,770
We've got to get
this place cleared out!

801
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:39,475
Hey, guys, guys.
Here we go.

802
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,671
We don't know
if he's in on it.

803
01:04:47,006 --> 01:04:48,399
What's he looking at?

804
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:09,212
Holy shit.

805
01:05:09,236 --> 01:05:10,756
Are you kidding me?

806
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,217
What the hell is he doing?
Gordon!

807
01:05:14,241 --> 01:05:18,037
Your guy's gonna get himself
killed in there.

808
01:05:33,302 --> 01:05:33,904
Please.

809
01:05:33,928 --> 01:05:37,533
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

810
01:05:37,557 --> 01:05:38,450
He told me if I didn't do

811
01:05:38,474 --> 01:05:39,994
exactly what he said,
he'd kill me.

812
01:05:40,018 --> 01:05:41,119
I'm so sorry.

813
01:05:41,143 --> 01:05:43,038
Looks like a combination lock.

814
01:05:43,062 --> 01:05:44,832
Can't we just cut it off?

815
01:05:44,856 --> 01:05:47,734
Not if you want
to keep your head.

816
01:06:23,561 --> 01:06:25,646
You came.

817
01:06:26,898 --> 01:06:28,584
Who are you?

818
01:06:28,608 --> 01:06:30,109
Me?

819
01:06:31,861 --> 01:06:34,113
I'm nobody.

820
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:37,133
I'm just an instrument,

821
01:06:37,157 --> 01:06:38,594
here to unmask the truth

822
01:06:38,618 --> 01:06:42,431
about this cesspool
we call a city.

823
01:06:42,455 --> 01:06:43,557
"Unmask"?

824
01:06:43,581 --> 01:06:45,059
Yes.

825
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:48,103
Let's do it
together, okay?

826
01:06:48,127 --> 01:06:51,106
I've been trying to reach you.

827
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:53,859
You're part of this, too.

828
01:06:53,883 --> 01:06:55,819
How am I a part of this?

829
01:06:55,843 --> 01:06:56,820
You'll see.

830
01:06:56,844 --> 01:06:58,655
Hey, Chief. You
better take a look at this.

831
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:01,700
Say
hello to my followers.

832
01:07:01,724 --> 01:07:02,493
We're live.

833
01:07:02,517 --> 01:07:06,521
They're here to watch
our little trial.

834
01:07:07,188 --> 01:07:07,915
At the moment,

835
01:07:07,939 --> 01:07:12,044
the man across
from you, Mr. Colson,

836
01:07:12,068 --> 01:07:12,753
is dead.

837
01:07:12,777 --> 01:07:14,129
Jesus, can we
get somebody out here?

838
01:07:14,153 --> 01:07:16,173
-This psycho's gonna kill me!
-But wait a minute...

839
01:07:16,197 --> 01:07:17,091
Shut up!

840
01:07:17,115 --> 01:07:19,385
You deserve to be dead
after what you did!

841
01:07:19,409 --> 01:07:22,513
You hear me?

842
01:07:22,537 --> 01:07:23,972
Okay.

843
01:07:31,712 --> 01:07:35,007
I'm giving you a chance.

844
01:07:35,716 --> 01:07:38,928
No one ever gave
me a chance.

845
01:07:40,471 --> 01:07:42,032
Now,

846
01:07:42,056 --> 01:07:44,535
ever since I was a child,

847
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,039
I've always loved
little puzzles.

848
01:07:49,063 --> 01:07:51,625
For me, they
are a retreat

849
01:07:51,649 --> 01:07:55,087
from the horrors of our world.

850
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:56,880
Maybe they can bring

851
01:07:56,904 --> 01:07:59,675
some comfort to you too,
Mr. Colson.

852
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:02,511
You want me to do puzzles?

853
01:08:02,535 --> 01:08:05,472
Three riddles
in two minutes.

854
01:08:05,496 --> 01:08:06,765
You give me the answers,

855
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:09,435
and I'll give you
the code for the lock.

856
01:08:09,459 --> 01:08:12,229
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

857
01:08:12,253 --> 01:08:14,022
Okay, okay. So I just...

858
01:08:14,046 --> 01:08:15,566
You want me to...

859
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:17,568
Riddle number one...

860
01:08:17,592 --> 01:08:19,736
"It can be cruel,

861
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,946
poetic, or blind,

862
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:26,119
"but when it's denied, it's
violence you may find."

863
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,080
Wait, wait, wait!
Can you repeat that?

864
01:08:29,104 --> 01:08:30,081
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

865
01:08:30,105 --> 01:08:31,623
-"Justice."
-Huh?

866
01:08:31,647 --> 01:08:32,791
The answer's "justice."

867
01:08:32,815 --> 01:08:34,085
-Justice?
-Yes!

868
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:35,128
-Oh, God.
-Justice!

869
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:37,921
And you
were supposed to be

870
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:39,381
an arm of justice
in this city,

871
01:08:39,405 --> 01:08:42,593
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

872
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:45,096
were you not, Mr. Colson?

873
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,014
Of course, of course.

874
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:48,183
-Of course.
-Riddle number two.

875
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:52,394
"If you are justice,
please do not lie.

876
01:08:52,418 --> 01:08:56,899
"What is the price
for your blind eye?"

877
01:08:56,923 --> 01:08:59,276
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

878
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,236
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

879
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,612
He's asking you
how much it cost

880
01:09:01,636 --> 01:09:02,989
for you to turn your back.

881
01:09:03,721 --> 01:09:05,282
Fifty-eight seconds!

882
01:09:05,306 --> 01:09:06,242
-How much?
-Nothing!

883
01:09:06,266 --> 01:09:08,952
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

884
01:09:08,977 --> 01:09:09,912
I get a monthly payment

885
01:09:09,936 --> 01:09:11,288
just not to prosecute
certain cases.

886
01:09:11,312 --> 01:09:12,664
-What cases?
-He didn't ask me that!

887
01:09:12,688 --> 01:09:14,541
Come on! Ten grand.

888
01:09:14,565 --> 01:09:16,335
That's my answer.
It's ten grand!

889
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:17,336
Okay. Okay. Okay.

890
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,796
Don't lose your head,
Mr. Colson.

891
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:24,510
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

892
01:09:24,534 --> 01:09:26,221
Last riddle.

893
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,516
"Since
your justice is so select,

894
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:35,521
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."

895
01:09:35,545 --> 01:09:37,856
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

896
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,942
The informant you all protect

897
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,193
from
the Salvatore Maroni case.

898
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,319
-How do you know about that?
-What's his name?

899
01:09:42,343 --> 01:09:43,654
-Twenty seconds.
-No.

900
01:09:43,678 --> 01:09:45,822
-He's gonna kill you.
-I'm a dead man either way.

901
01:09:45,846 --> 01:09:47,158
You're talking
to a dead man, okay?

902
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:48,534
If I go out this way,
it's just me.

903
01:09:48,558 --> 01:09:52,163
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

904
01:09:52,187 --> 01:09:53,497
-He'll kill them, too.
-Who will?

905
01:09:53,521 --> 01:09:54,874
-People are watching.
-What people?

906
01:09:54,898 --> 01:09:57,501
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

907
01:09:57,525 --> 01:09:58,418
It's the whole system!

908
01:09:58,442 --> 01:10:00,296
Five! Four!

909
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,006
-Oh, God, have mercy on
me... -Three!

910
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,300
Goodbye!

911
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:35,706
Who do you
think he is under there?

912
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,482
- Take it easy.
- I want to see.

913
01:10:38,733 --> 01:10:40,944
What is that thing?
Leather?

914
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:44,966
What's he got
on his eyes?

915
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,550
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

916
01:10:46,574 --> 01:10:48,177
-We are we doing here?
-Let's just take it off...

917
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:50,263
Hey!

918
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:52,556
Hey! Hey! Hey!

919
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,349
Hey! Hey!

920
01:10:53,373 --> 01:10:54,767
Relax, God damn it!

921
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:57,377
You're protecting
this guy, Jim?

922
01:10:57,668 --> 01:11:00,773
He interfered in an active
hostage situation.

923
01:11:00,797 --> 01:11:03,567
Colson's blood
is on his hands.

924
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:05,635
Maybe it's on yours.

925
01:11:06,427 --> 01:11:07,238
What'd you say?

926
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:09,573
He would rather die than talk.

927
01:11:09,597 --> 01:11:11,892
What was he afraid of?

928
01:11:12,225 --> 01:11:13,328
You?

929
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,252
You son of a bitch.

930
01:11:21,276 --> 01:11:24,630
You have any idea what kind
of trouble you're in?

931
01:11:24,654 --> 01:11:26,423
You could be
an accessory to murder.

932
01:11:26,447 --> 01:11:27,967
Why are we
playing games...

933
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,054
Get him! Come on!

934
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,471
Back off! Back off!

935
01:11:32,495 --> 01:11:35,099
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

936
01:11:35,123 --> 01:11:36,976
You got me
on assaulting three.

937
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:37,517
Hey!

938
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:41,213
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

939
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:43,983
You too now?

940
01:11:44,007 --> 01:11:46,903
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

941
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:48,821
You're gonna put yourself
on the line

942
01:11:48,845 --> 01:11:49,739
for this scumbag, Jim?

943
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:53,058
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

944
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:57,312
Okay, give him the room.

945
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:14,246
Two minutes.

946
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,592
You listen to me.

947
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:31,179
We gotta get you out of here.

948
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,700
That would put
a lot of heat on you.

949
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:36,559
Well, you punched me
in the face.

950
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,063
Take this key.

951
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:41,457
Through that door.

952
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:44,377
Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

953
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:47,422
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

954
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,924
Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on?

955
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:56,538
Who's the mustache
with the broken nose?

956
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,436
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

957
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,646
He's one of the guys
I got into it with

958
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:05,732
at the Iceberg Lounge.

959
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:06,607
What are you saying?

960
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:09,217
Kenzie moonlights
for the Penguin?

961
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:13,889
Or he moonlights as a cop.

962
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:19,036
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

963
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,788
Somebody stop him!

964
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:01,228
- There he is!
- Freeze!

965
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:49,545
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

966
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:50,379
I did.

967
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,088
Bock put out an APB on you.

968
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:53,631
You really think
he's in on this?

969
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:56,259
I don't trust any of 'em.
Do you?

970
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,009
I only trust you.

971
01:14:57,033 --> 01:14:59,262
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

972
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:01,848
Colson said,
"Cops protect the rat."

973
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,683
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

974
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:05,059
You think Penguin's the rat?

975
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,436
His club caters to the mob.

976
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,604
Maroni
practically lived there.

977
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:10,231
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

978
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,190
DA was a regular, too.

979
01:15:11,214 --> 01:15:12,942
Maybe Penguin
got himself into a jam

980
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:15,987
and working a deal
was his only way out.

981
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:18,823
-TheRata Alada.
-The what?

982
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,157
Riddler's latest.

983
01:15:20,181 --> 01:15:21,200
The cipher in the maze.

984
01:15:21,224 --> 01:15:25,186
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

985
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,399
A penguin's got wings, too.

986
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,960
Time for me to have
another conversation with him.

987
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:33,422
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

988
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:34,298
It's all connected.

989
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:36,090
Like it or not,
it's his game now.

990
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:39,969
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

991
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:43,557
Kenzie and the twins,

992
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,475
coming your way.

993
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,393
There's Penguin.

994
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:49,337
I wonder
what's in the bags.

995
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,214
You want to move in?

996
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,651
Let's follow.

997
01:16:12,817 --> 01:16:14,962
They stopped
at Waterfront Street.

998
01:16:14,986 --> 01:16:16,881
The recycling plant.

999
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,716
I'm here.

1000
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,303
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

1001
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,220
Good, good.

1002
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,640
Let's get in
out of this deluge.

1003
01:16:43,014 --> 01:16:45,826
It's a drug lab. Drops.

1004
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:46,578
This is a buy.

1005
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,580
Looks like
they got Maroni's operation

1006
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:49,747
up and running again.

1007
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,083
Or they never
shut it down at all.

1008
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,250
What
are you saying?

1009
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:56,171
The biggest drug bust
in GCPD history was a fraud?

1010
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,531
This just got complicated.

1011
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,348
What do you mean?

1012
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,456
Hey! What happened?

1013
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,315
You all right?

1014
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,053
Dangerous crowd
you're stealing from.

1015
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,139
Jesus.

1016
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:49,474
Is this how
you get your kicks, hon?

1017
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:50,850
Sneaking up on girls
in the dark?

1018
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:53,770
Is that why
you work in the club?

1019
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:54,646
It was all just a score?

1020
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,440
You know, I would love
to sit and go over

1021
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:58,400
every gory detail
with you, bat boy,

1022
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:02,595
but, uh, those assholes
are coming back.

1023
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:15,899
Jesus!

1024
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:44,720
Hey, Vengeance!

1025
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:49,600
You think you can come
after my money, huh?

1026
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,326
Kenzie! Get the money!

1027
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:38,691
Hey! What the...

1028
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:30,367
Whoa!

1029
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:35,414
Come on! Come on!

1030
01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:40,586
This guy's crazy!

1031
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,380
Come on! Hey!

1032
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,807
Move!

1033
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:40,415
Get out of the way!

1034
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,635
Come on!

1035
01:23:00,602 --> 01:23:02,479
Get out of the way!

1036
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:41,726
I got you!

1037
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:43,286
I got you!

1038
01:23:43,311 --> 01:23:46,206
Take that,
you friggin' psycho!

1039
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:48,232
I got you!

1040
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,537
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

1041
01:25:06,561 --> 01:25:09,457
-Who's the Riddler?
-Riddler? How should I know?

1042
01:25:09,481 --> 01:25:11,041
Let's make it
easy for you, Oz.

1043
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:12,251
Cops caught you
doing something.

1044
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:13,961
They were gonna
shut you down, put you away.

1045
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:16,131
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

1046
01:25:16,155 --> 01:25:18,632
You ratted out
Salvatore Maroni.

1047
01:25:18,656 --> 01:25:19,508
His drops operation.

1048
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:21,427
But the cops,
the city officials,

1049
01:25:21,451 --> 01:25:22,386
the mayor, the DA,

1050
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:23,345
they got greedy, right?

1051
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:25,514
Wasn't enough,
a big career-making bust.

1052
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:27,225
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

1053
01:25:27,249 --> 01:25:29,852
but they needed a minor league
mope like you to run it.

1054
01:25:29,876 --> 01:25:32,605
You don't just work
for Carmine Falcone.

1055
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:33,856
You work for them, too.

1056
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,732
What are you, crazy?

1057
01:25:34,756 --> 01:25:36,109
That why
you killed the girl?

1058
01:25:36,133 --> 01:25:37,026
I didn't kill no girl!

1059
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:38,944
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

1060
01:25:38,968 --> 01:25:40,321
But she got too close, right?

1061
01:25:40,345 --> 01:25:41,280
Found out from Mitchell

1062
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:42,740
that you were the rat,
so you killed her.

1063
01:25:42,764 --> 01:25:44,492
But somehow
Riddler found out, too.

1064
01:25:44,516 --> 01:25:46,285
He knows so much about you.

1065
01:25:46,309 --> 01:25:48,871
-You must know about him.
-Who is he?

1066
01:25:48,895 --> 01:25:51,582
Boy, you guys are a hell
of a duet here.

1067
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:52,875
Why don't you start
harmonizing?

1068
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:56,337
There's only one problem with
your little scenario, okay?

1069
01:25:56,361 --> 01:25:57,130
I ain't no rat!

1070
01:25:57,154 --> 01:25:59,465
You got any idea what
Carmine Falcone would do to me

1071
01:25:59,489 --> 01:26:00,549
if he heard this kind of talk?

1072
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:02,843
Oh, you don't wanna talk
about rats, huh?

1073
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:03,802
Maybe we can talk about

1074
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,180
what they did
to my partner's face.

1075
01:26:05,204 --> 01:26:06,805
Holy God, what are you
showing me here?

1076
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:08,891
-This was around his head!
-Come on!

1077
01:26:08,915 --> 01:26:11,668
Open your eyes!

1078
01:26:14,712 --> 01:26:16,732
Are youEl Rata Alada?

1079
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:17,608
El Rata Alada?

1080
01:26:17,632 --> 01:26:18,943
Yeah,
a "rat with wings."

1081
01:26:18,967 --> 01:26:20,486
A stool pigeon.
That's not you?

1082
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,113
The symbols in the maze,
right here.

1083
01:26:22,137 --> 01:26:24,657
It says you
areEl Rata Alada.

1084
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:26,076
"You areEl Rata"?
It says that?

1085
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,078
Why, you got something
to tell us?

1086
01:26:28,102 --> 01:26:28,661
Yeah!

1087
01:26:28,685 --> 01:26:30,621
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

1088
01:26:30,645 --> 01:26:33,250
-What?
-It's"La."

1089
01:26:33,274 --> 01:26:34,292
"La" rata.

1090
01:26:34,316 --> 01:26:36,919
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

1091
01:26:36,943 --> 01:26:39,130
Jesus! Look at you two.

1092
01:26:39,154 --> 01:26:41,423
World's greatest detectives!

1093
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:43,009
Am I the only here
knows the difference

1094
01:26:43,033 --> 01:26:44,177
between"el"and"la"?

1095
01:26:44,201 --> 01:26:46,845
Jesus!
No habla espanol,fellas?

1096
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:49,872
Do me a favor, shithead,
shut up!

1097
01:26:50,415 --> 01:26:51,767
You think he made a mistake?

1098
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:52,810
He doesn't made mistakes.

1099
01:26:52,834 --> 01:26:53,852
A rat with wings?

1100
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:55,272
You know what
that sounds like to me?

1101
01:26:55,296 --> 01:26:58,984
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1102
01:26:59,008 --> 01:27:01,801
"You areEl Rata."

1103
01:27:06,974 --> 01:27:08,659
"You"...

1104
01:27:08,683 --> 01:27:09,702
"are"...

1105
01:27:09,726 --> 01:27:11,270
"El."

1106
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:21,463
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1107
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:23,531
Wait.

1108
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:28,387
Is that him?

1109
01:27:28,411 --> 01:27:31,099
Holy shit.

1110
01:27:49,432 --> 01:27:52,518
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1111
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:24,526
"I grew up from a seed,
tough as a weed...

1112
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:27,280
But in a mansion,
in a slum...

1113
01:28:27,304 --> 01:28:30,449
I'll never know
where I come from.

1114
01:28:30,473 --> 01:28:32,243
Do you know what I am?"

1115
01:28:32,267 --> 01:28:33,787
Any idea?

1116
01:28:33,811 --> 01:28:35,270
Yeah.

1117
01:28:36,021 --> 01:28:37,940
It's an orphan.

1118
01:28:46,073 --> 01:28:48,574
A mansion in a slum.

1119
01:28:48,951 --> 01:28:50,845
He's talking about
the old orphanage.

1120
01:28:50,869 --> 01:28:51,805
The one that burned down?

1121
01:28:51,829 --> 01:28:53,973
It was part of
the Wayne estate.

1122
01:28:53,997 --> 01:28:57,060
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1123
01:28:57,084 --> 01:28:58,584
Let's go.

1124
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:03,340
You guys realize
I'm still here, right?

1125
01:29:03,716 --> 01:29:04,566
You gonna untie me?

1126
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:07,261
How the hell am I supposed
to get out of here?

1127
01:29:10,764 --> 01:29:12,182
Hey!

1128
01:29:12,474 --> 01:29:15,453
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1129
01:29:28,949 --> 01:29:32,327
No guns.

1130
01:29:32,494 --> 01:29:35,831
Yeah, man.
That's your thing.

1131
01:29:56,351 --> 01:29:58,103
What's that?

1132
01:30:08,322 --> 01:30:10,699
Hey! Hey!

1133
01:30:16,622 --> 01:30:17,932
Dropheads.

1134
01:30:25,005 --> 01:30:27,424
What the hell is that?

1135
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,914
Thank
you. Thank you so much.

1136
01:30:40,938 --> 01:30:42,898
Wasn't that beautiful?

1137
01:30:44,441 --> 01:30:47,086
Thank you all.
Thank you, uh...

1138
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:49,696
Thank you for
coming today.

1139
01:30:50,614 --> 01:30:53,033
I believe in Gotham.

1140
01:30:53,367 --> 01:30:55,720
I believe in its promise.

1141
01:30:55,744 --> 01:31:00,518
But too many have been
left behind for too long,

1142
01:31:00,542 --> 01:31:01,684
and that's why I'm here today.

1143
01:31:01,708 --> 01:31:04,395
To announce, not only
my candidacy for mayor,

1144
01:31:04,419 --> 01:31:09,317
but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.

1145
01:31:09,341 --> 01:31:10,109
Win or lose,

1146
01:31:10,133 --> 01:31:13,447
the Wayne Foundation pledges
a one billion dollar donation

1147
01:31:13,471 --> 01:31:17,116
to start a charitable
endowment for public works.

1148
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,993
I want to bypass
political gridlock,

1149
01:31:19,017 --> 01:31:21,746
and get money
to people and projects

1150
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:23,832
who need it now,

1151
01:31:23,856 --> 01:31:25,543
like these children behind me.

1152
01:31:25,567 --> 01:31:26,460
"Sins of the father."

1153
01:31:26,484 --> 01:31:30,630
Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds

1154
01:31:30,654 --> 01:31:34,300
and renewing
Gotham's promise.

1155
01:31:37,703 --> 01:31:40,914
Shall be visited upon the son.

1156
01:31:41,583 --> 01:31:46,003
Jesus. His next victim
is Bruce Wayne.

1157
01:31:50,173 --> 01:31:51,402
Hey!

1158
01:32:50,817 --> 01:32:52,086
-Hello?
-Dory!

1159
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:53,087
I need to speak to Alfred!

1160
01:32:53,111 --> 01:32:55,131
-Oh, Mr. Wayne...
-Listen to me!

1161
01:32:55,155 --> 01:32:57,551
Something terrible
is gonna happen!

1162
01:32:57,575 --> 01:33:00,762
I'm afraid
it already has, sir.

1163
01:33:11,088 --> 01:33:14,091
About an hour ago.

1164
01:33:14,634 --> 01:33:16,927
I'm so sorry.

1165
01:33:17,595 --> 01:33:20,306
I've been trying to reach you.

1166
01:33:21,391 --> 01:33:24,035
The package
was intended for you.

1167
01:33:24,059 --> 01:33:26,913
It was a C-4 explosive
sent in a mailer.

1168
01:33:26,937 --> 01:33:29,064
We found this too.

1169
01:33:51,044 --> 01:33:52,231
We've sedated him.

1170
01:33:52,255 --> 01:33:54,483
We just have to hope
he stabilizes.

1171
01:33:54,507 --> 01:33:58,027
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1172
01:33:58,051 --> 01:34:00,929
Is there anyone else
to notify?

1173
01:34:01,681 --> 01:34:03,599
Next of kin?

1174
01:34:08,396 --> 01:34:09,896
No.

1175
01:34:10,398 --> 01:34:12,525
It's just me.

1176
01:35:55,169 --> 01:35:56,921
Selina?

1177
01:36:02,886 --> 01:36:04,512
Can you see me?

1178
01:36:06,389 --> 01:36:10,268
-Yeah, I can see you.
-I need to talk to you.

1179
01:36:10,434 --> 01:36:12,270
Where can we go?

1180
01:36:29,495 --> 01:36:32,623
Cat burglar
pulling another score?

1181
01:36:33,082 --> 01:36:33,725
What?

1182
01:36:33,749 --> 01:36:34,977
Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1183
01:36:35,001 --> 01:36:36,395
Yeah, well,
things were getting

1184
01:36:36,419 --> 01:36:38,564
a little hot for me, so...

1185
01:36:38,588 --> 01:36:40,190
How could they do that to her?

1186
01:36:40,214 --> 01:36:42,651
That piece of shit cop,
Kenzie.

1187
01:36:42,675 --> 01:36:43,944
Her body was in his car.

1188
01:36:43,968 --> 01:36:46,405
I'm gonna find him
and I'm gonna make him pay.

1189
01:36:46,429 --> 01:36:48,073
-You gonna help me?
-Help you?

1190
01:36:48,097 --> 01:36:50,033
Yeah. I thought
you were "Vengeance."

1191
01:36:50,057 --> 01:36:52,119
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1192
01:36:52,143 --> 01:36:53,370
She didn't know any better.

1193
01:36:53,394 --> 01:36:54,914
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1194
01:36:54,938 --> 01:36:56,582
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1195
01:36:56,606 --> 01:36:58,625
It means your choices
have consequences.

1196
01:36:58,649 --> 01:37:00,752
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1197
01:37:00,777 --> 01:37:02,212
You know,
whoever the hell you are,

1198
01:37:02,236 --> 01:37:03,840
you obviously grew up rich.

1199
01:37:03,864 --> 01:37:05,632
-Was it worth it?
-What?

1200
01:37:05,656 --> 01:37:08,887
Compromising yourself
for money?

1201
01:37:08,911 --> 01:37:12,598
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1202
01:37:12,622 --> 01:37:16,435
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1203
01:37:16,459 --> 01:37:18,145
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1204
01:37:18,169 --> 01:37:20,355
-Falcone owes me that money.
-He owes you?

1205
01:37:20,379 --> 01:37:22,149
-Yeah, and a lot more.
-Oh, really? Why's that?

1206
01:37:22,173 --> 01:37:23,860
You know what?
I can't even talk to you.

1207
01:37:23,884 --> 01:37:24,693
No! I want to know

1208
01:37:24,717 --> 01:37:26,445
why a guy like Falcone
would owe you anything.

1209
01:37:26,469 --> 01:37:29,806
Because he's my father!

1210
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:41,735
My mother worked
at the 44 Below.

1211
01:37:42,568 --> 01:37:44,528
Just like Anni.

1212
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:49,242
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1213
01:37:50,744 --> 01:37:52,662
To the club?

1214
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,580
Yeah.

1215
01:37:55,874 --> 01:37:59,812
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1216
01:37:59,836 --> 01:38:02,147
Used to see him there.

1217
01:38:02,171 --> 01:38:05,132
He scared the shit out of me.

1218
01:38:06,175 --> 01:38:07,194
And I could never understand

1219
01:38:07,218 --> 01:38:09,571
why he looked at me
the way he did.

1220
01:38:09,595 --> 01:38:14,810
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1221
01:38:16,979 --> 01:38:20,606
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1222
01:38:20,732 --> 01:38:22,417
Strangled.

1223
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:23,377
Never found out who.

1224
01:38:23,401 --> 01:38:26,655
Probably some creep
from the club.

1225
01:38:27,071 --> 01:38:29,717
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1226
01:38:29,741 --> 01:38:32,869
and he didn't say a thing.

1227
01:38:33,912 --> 01:38:36,497
Couldn't even look at me.

1228
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:42,004
He owes me that money.

1229
01:38:43,296 --> 01:38:45,214
I'm sorry.

1230
01:38:45,757 --> 01:38:47,508
For what I said.

1231
01:38:48,134 --> 01:38:50,303
Ah, it's all right.

1232
01:38:52,681 --> 01:38:55,892
You assume the worst
in people.

1233
01:38:56,183 --> 01:38:58,185
Which, well...

1234
01:38:59,312 --> 01:39:02,566
maybe we're not
so different after all.

1235
01:39:07,111 --> 01:39:09,614
Who are you under there?

1236
01:39:14,953 --> 01:39:17,581
What are you hiding?

1237
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:21,793
Are you just...

1238
01:39:22,669 --> 01:39:25,088
hideously scarred?

1239
01:39:26,757 --> 01:39:28,215
Yeah.

1240
01:39:34,806 --> 01:39:36,850
Listen to me.

1241
01:39:37,224 --> 01:39:41,163
If we don't stand up
for Annika, no one will.

1242
01:39:41,187 --> 01:39:43,415
All anyone cares about
in this place

1243
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:46,627
are these white,
privileged assholes.

1244
01:39:46,651 --> 01:39:49,964
The mayor,
the commissioner, the DA.

1245
01:39:49,988 --> 01:39:51,173
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1246
01:39:51,197 --> 01:39:52,382
I mean, as far
as I'm concerned,

1247
01:39:52,406 --> 01:39:54,719
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1248
01:39:54,743 --> 01:39:55,887
I think you'd be on his side.

1249
01:39:55,911 --> 01:39:57,805
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1250
01:39:57,829 --> 01:39:59,264
What, do you live in a cave?

1251
01:39:59,288 --> 01:40:02,560
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1252
01:40:02,584 --> 01:40:07,356
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1253
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,132
will you help me?

1254
01:40:09,883 --> 01:40:11,676
Please.

1255
01:40:13,678 --> 01:40:16,347
Come on, Vengeance.

1256
01:40:17,348 --> 01:40:19,869
Just don't make any moves
without me, understand?

1257
01:40:19,893 --> 01:40:22,080
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1258
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:34,198
I told you, baby.

1259
01:40:35,075 --> 01:40:38,537
I can take care of myself.

1260
01:40:47,629 --> 01:40:51,901
I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.

1261
01:40:59,724 --> 01:41:00,618
From a very young age,

1262
01:41:00,642 --> 01:41:03,329
my family, Martha's family,
the Arkhams,

1263
01:41:03,353 --> 01:41:04,539
instilled in
both of us

1264
01:41:04,563 --> 01:41:08,167
that giving back
is not just an obligation,

1265
01:41:08,191 --> 01:41:10,002
it's a passion.

1266
01:41:10,026 --> 01:41:13,047
That is our
family's legacy.

1267
01:41:13,071 --> 01:41:15,967
The
Waynes and the Arkhams.

1268
01:41:15,991 --> 01:41:18,636
Gotham's founding
families.

1269
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:22,515
But what is their real legacy?

1270
01:41:22,539 --> 01:41:25,977
Twenty years ago,
one reporter set out

1271
01:41:26,001 --> 01:41:27,437
to uncover the
dark truth.

1272
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:31,774
He found
shocking family secrets.

1273
01:41:31,798 --> 01:41:33,693
How, when Martha
was just a child,

1274
01:41:33,717 --> 01:41:36,404
her mother brutally
murdered her father,

1275
01:41:36,428 --> 01:41:37,738
then committed
suicide...

1276
01:41:37,762 --> 01:41:39,157
...and how the Arkhams

1277
01:41:39,181 --> 01:41:43,911
used their power and
money to cover it up.

1278
01:41:43,935 --> 01:41:45,455
How Martha herself

1279
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:48,291
was in and out of
institutions for years,

1280
01:41:48,315 --> 01:41:51,002
and they didn't want
anyone to know.

1281
01:41:51,026 --> 01:41:53,379
Thomas Wayne tried to
force this crusading reporter

1282
01:41:53,403 --> 01:41:58,134
into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.

1283
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:00,470
But when
the reporter refused,

1284
01:42:00,494 --> 01:42:03,931
Wayne turned to
longtime secret associate

1285
01:42:03,955 --> 01:42:04,807
Carmine Falcone,

1286
01:42:04,831 --> 01:42:07,477
and had him murdered!

1287
01:42:07,501 --> 01:42:11,231
The Waynes and
the Arkhams,

1288
01:42:11,255 --> 01:42:16,736
Gotham's legacy
of lies and murder.

1289
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:19,822
I hopeyou're
listening, Bruce Wayne.

1290
01:42:19,846 --> 01:42:22,533
This is your legacy too.

1291
01:42:22,557 --> 01:42:25,536
And Gotham needs you to answer

1292
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:29,773
for the
sins of your father.

1293
01:42:30,732 --> 01:42:33,109
Goodbye.

1294
01:42:37,906 --> 01:42:39,783
Do you know who I am?

1295
01:42:40,659 --> 01:42:41,677
You're Bruce Wayne.

1296
01:42:41,701 --> 01:42:44,496
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1297
01:42:54,839 --> 01:42:56,259
See?

1298
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:10,082
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1299
01:43:10,106 --> 01:43:12,041
Must have made a fortune.

1300
01:43:12,065 --> 01:43:15,212
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1301
01:43:15,236 --> 01:43:18,506
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1302
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:19,715
No, boss.

1303
01:43:19,739 --> 01:43:22,094
$1,183.

1304
01:43:22,118 --> 01:43:24,554
You know
why communism failed, right?

1305
01:43:24,578 --> 01:43:26,330
No, boss.

1306
01:43:27,497 --> 01:43:28,975
Austerity.

1307
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:32,062
All right. All right.

1308
01:43:32,086 --> 01:43:34,730
Look at that. Perfect.

1309
01:43:34,754 --> 01:43:37,882
It's never gonna be
that good again.

1310
01:43:39,384 --> 01:43:41,904
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1311
01:43:41,928 --> 01:43:43,805
What are you doing here?

1312
01:43:44,764 --> 01:43:47,559
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1313
01:43:47,767 --> 01:43:49,519
Come on.

1314
01:43:50,812 --> 01:43:52,647
See ya, champ.

1315
01:43:52,897 --> 01:43:54,899
Come on, sweetheart.

1316
01:43:56,277 --> 01:43:57,861
Have a seat.

1317
01:43:58,820 --> 01:44:01,632
I thought
I might hear from you.

1318
01:44:01,656 --> 01:44:05,995
This, uh, Riddler
son of a bitch is really

1319
01:44:06,786 --> 01:44:08,514
stirring things up, huh?

1320
01:44:08,538 --> 01:44:11,125
-Is it true?
-What?

1321
01:44:11,583 --> 01:44:14,045
That reporter business?

1322
01:44:14,378 --> 01:44:15,813
What do you want
to know here, kid?

1323
01:44:15,837 --> 01:44:18,524
Did you kill him?
For my father?

1324
01:44:18,548 --> 01:44:22,362
Look, your father
was in trouble.

1325
01:44:22,386 --> 01:44:24,655
This reporter had some dirt.

1326
01:44:24,679 --> 01:44:26,741
Some very

1327
01:44:26,765 --> 01:44:29,869
personal stuff
about your mother,

1328
01:44:29,893 --> 01:44:30,745
her family history.

1329
01:44:30,769 --> 01:44:32,788
You know, everybody's got
their dirty laundry,

1330
01:44:32,812 --> 01:44:33,706
that's just how it is.

1331
01:44:33,730 --> 01:44:35,167
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1332
01:44:35,191 --> 01:44:37,169
not right before the election.

1333
01:44:37,193 --> 01:44:39,795
And your father
tried to pay the guy off,

1334
01:44:39,819 --> 01:44:42,090
but he wasn't going for it.

1335
01:44:42,114 --> 01:44:43,633
So...

1336
01:44:43,657 --> 01:44:44,634
he came to me.

1337
01:44:44,658 --> 01:44:48,204
Well, I never seen him
like that.

1338
01:44:48,329 --> 01:44:50,140
He said, "Carmine,

1339
01:44:50,164 --> 01:44:56,379
"I want you to put
the fear of God in this guy."

1340
01:44:57,837 --> 01:45:01,716
And when fear isn't enough...

1341
01:45:01,967 --> 01:45:03,886
Oof. Hmm.

1342
01:45:04,095 --> 01:45:08,849
Your father wanted me
to handle it, so I did.

1343
01:45:09,225 --> 01:45:11,685
I handled it.

1344
01:45:12,895 --> 01:45:13,621
I know.

1345
01:45:13,645 --> 01:45:17,149
You thought your father
was a Boy Scout.

1346
01:45:17,607 --> 01:45:19,336
But you'd be surprised

1347
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,462
what even a good man like him

1348
01:45:21,486 --> 01:45:25,366
is capable of
in the right situation.

1349
01:45:26,992 --> 01:45:28,428
Do me a favor.

1350
01:45:28,452 --> 01:45:31,514
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1351
01:45:31,538 --> 01:45:33,748
This reporter

1352
01:45:33,958 --> 01:45:35,310
was a lowlife.

1353
01:45:35,334 --> 01:45:37,711
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1354
01:45:38,545 --> 01:45:40,148
-Maroni?
-Oh, yeah.

1355
01:45:40,172 --> 01:45:44,319
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1356
01:45:44,343 --> 01:45:47,364
And... And after what happened
with that reporter,

1357
01:45:47,388 --> 01:45:48,698
Maroni was worried

1358
01:45:48,722 --> 01:45:52,268
that your father
would be in my pocket

1359
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,744
forever.

1360
01:45:53,769 --> 01:45:55,621
He would have done anything

1361
01:45:55,645 --> 01:45:58,375
to keep him
from becoming mayor.

1362
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:00,401
You understand?

1363
01:46:00,985 --> 01:46:01,878
Are you saying

1364
01:46:01,902 --> 01:46:05,465
Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1365
01:46:05,489 --> 01:46:08,284
Do I know it for a fact?

1366
01:46:09,326 --> 01:46:12,788
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1367
01:46:13,205 --> 01:46:15,558
This is what you wanted, huh?

1368
01:46:15,582 --> 01:46:18,602
This little conversation here?

1369
01:46:20,337 --> 01:46:23,548
It's been
a long time coming, huh?

1370
01:46:25,092 --> 01:46:28,304
I mean,
you ain't a kid no more.

1371
01:47:37,373 --> 01:47:39,291
You lied to me...

1372
01:47:41,502 --> 01:47:43,754
my whole life.

1373
01:47:48,008 --> 01:47:50,970
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1374
01:47:52,556 --> 01:47:57,101
He told me what he did
for my father.

1375
01:48:00,396 --> 01:48:02,731
About Salvatore Maroni.

1376
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,587
He told you
Salvatore Maroni...

1377
01:48:06,611 --> 01:48:09,154
Had my father killed.

1378
01:48:10,532 --> 01:48:13,826
Why didn't you tell me
all this?

1379
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:20,518
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1380
01:48:20,542 --> 01:48:23,311
believing that he was
a good man.

1381
01:48:23,335 --> 01:48:25,689
He was a good man.

1382
01:48:25,713 --> 01:48:27,190
You listen to me.

1383
01:48:27,214 --> 01:48:31,553
Your father was a good man.

1384
01:48:34,221 --> 01:48:36,658
-He made a mistake.
-A "mistake."

1385
01:48:36,682 --> 01:48:38,994
He had a man killed.

1386
01:48:39,018 --> 01:48:40,538
Why?

1387
01:48:40,562 --> 01:48:44,940
To protect his family image?

1388
01:48:45,149 --> 01:48:46,126
His political aspirations?

1389
01:48:46,150 --> 01:48:47,711
It wasn't to protect
the family image,

1390
01:48:47,735 --> 01:48:50,905
and he didn't have
anyone killed.

1391
01:48:52,532 --> 01:48:54,217
He was protecting your mother.

1392
01:48:54,241 --> 01:48:58,889
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1393
01:48:58,913 --> 01:49:01,391
He cared about her

1394
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:01,933
and you,

1395
01:49:01,957 --> 01:49:04,645
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1396
01:49:04,669 --> 01:49:09,525
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1397
01:49:09,549 --> 01:49:11,234
Your father should have known

1398
01:49:11,258 --> 01:49:12,570
that Falcone would do anything

1399
01:49:12,594 --> 01:49:16,323
to finally have something
on him that he could use.

1400
01:49:16,347 --> 01:49:18,891
That's who Falcone is.

1401
01:49:20,017 --> 01:49:22,455
And that was
your father's mistake.

1402
01:49:22,479 --> 01:49:24,706
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1403
01:49:24,730 --> 01:49:27,834
your father was distraught.

1404
01:49:27,858 --> 01:49:31,338
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1405
01:49:31,363 --> 01:49:34,740
that he would confess
everything.

1406
01:49:35,575 --> 01:49:37,386
And that night,

1407
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:40,514
your father and your mother

1408
01:49:40,538 --> 01:49:42,247
were killed.

1409
01:49:47,044 --> 01:49:49,422
It was Falcone?

1410
01:49:54,594 --> 01:49:57,597
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1411
01:50:00,975 --> 01:50:04,996
Or maybe it was some
random thug on the street

1412
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:06,415
who needed money, got scared,

1413
01:50:06,439 --> 01:50:07,625
and pulled the trigger
too fast.

1414
01:50:07,649 --> 01:50:11,127
If you don't think
I've spent every day

1415
01:50:11,151 --> 01:50:14,029
searching for that answer...

1416
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:19,261
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1417
01:50:19,285 --> 01:50:21,389
I know you always
blamed yourself.

1418
01:50:21,413 --> 01:50:24,749
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1419
01:50:25,709 --> 01:50:29,169
I could see the fear
in your eyes,

1420
01:50:29,629 --> 01:50:31,856
but I didn't know how to help.

1421
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:35,528
I could teach you
how to fight,

1422
01:50:35,552 --> 01:50:38,905
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1423
01:50:38,929 --> 01:50:41,516
You needed a father.

1424
01:50:42,642 --> 01:50:45,894
And all you had was me.

1425
01:50:47,731 --> 01:50:49,482
I'm sorry.

1426
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,152
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1427
01:50:59,534 --> 01:51:01,035
God.

1428
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:08,418
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1429
01:51:10,085 --> 01:51:13,256
I thought
I'd mastered all that.

1430
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:20,971
I mean,

1431
01:51:21,389 --> 01:51:24,309
I'm not afraid to die.

1432
01:51:24,975 --> 01:51:28,438
I realize now
there's something

1433
01:51:28,813 --> 01:51:31,441
I haven't got past.

1434
01:51:31,775 --> 01:51:34,109
This fear...

1435
01:51:35,236 --> 01:51:39,532
of ever going through
any of that again.

1436
01:51:42,619 --> 01:51:45,954
Of losing somebody
I care about.

1437
01:52:36,172 --> 01:52:36,690
Hey.

1438
01:52:36,714 --> 01:52:39,693
I saw the signal.
That's not you?

1439
01:52:39,717 --> 01:52:42,303
I thought it was you.

1440
01:52:54,190 --> 01:52:55,917
-I found him!
-I see that.

1441
01:52:55,941 --> 01:52:57,211
He had my shit and my phone.

1442
01:52:57,235 --> 01:52:58,838
She left a message
the night they took her.

1443
01:52:58,862 --> 01:53:01,841
-She called me...
-Gordon! Help me out, man!

1444
01:53:01,865 --> 01:53:03,634
She got my gun!

1445
01:53:04,450 --> 01:53:06,971
-Shut up!
-Put the gun down.

1446
01:53:06,995 --> 01:53:10,957
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1447
01:53:14,294 --> 01:53:17,589
Here. Listen.

1448
01:53:18,298 --> 01:53:20,234
Hey! Get back here!

1449
01:53:20,258 --> 01:53:22,153
Where you going?

1450
01:53:22,177 --> 01:53:22,945
Come back here!

1451
01:53:22,969 --> 01:53:24,947
Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?

1452
01:53:24,971 --> 01:53:25,907
You're scaring her.

1453
01:53:25,931 --> 01:53:27,575
I'm...
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1454
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:29,326
Please, please, please.

1455
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:30,327
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1456
01:53:30,351 --> 01:53:34,314
Hey, don't be scared.
Come here.

1457
01:53:35,273 --> 01:53:37,251
Now let me ask you again.

1458
01:53:37,275 --> 01:53:40,212
- What did Mitchell tell you?
- No, nothing. He...

1459
01:53:40,236 --> 01:53:43,299
Don liked to talk.
I know that.

1460
01:53:43,323 --> 01:53:46,427
Especially to pretty girls
like you.

1461
01:53:46,451 --> 01:53:49,054
That's why I made him
take your passport,

1462
01:53:49,078 --> 01:53:52,016
until we could have
this little conversation.

1463
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,810
All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?

1464
01:53:54,834 --> 01:53:57,354
You'll never hear from me
again, nobody will.

1465
01:53:57,378 --> 01:53:58,272
Please, please...

1466
01:53:58,296 --> 01:54:01,609
We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

1467
01:54:01,633 --> 01:54:04,820
But first, I
gotta know...

1468
01:54:04,845 --> 01:54:06,780
- What did he tell you?
- He...

1469
01:54:06,804 --> 01:54:10,869
He just said they all made
a deal with you.

1470
01:54:10,893 --> 01:54:15,080
Oh. Hmm.
He told you about that, huh?

1471
01:54:15,104 --> 01:54:16,415
The deal.

1472
01:54:16,439 --> 01:54:17,208
He said

1473
01:54:17,232 --> 01:54:20,879
you gave some information
on some drops thing,

1474
01:54:20,903 --> 01:54:23,422
and that's how
he became mayor.

1475
01:54:23,446 --> 01:54:26,675
He said you were
a very important man.

1476
01:54:26,699 --> 01:54:28,493
Right.

1477
01:54:28,701 --> 01:54:30,536
Mm-hmm.

1478
01:54:30,871 --> 01:54:33,748
Hmm. Okay.

1479
01:54:39,922 --> 01:54:41,858
Just take it easy.

1480
01:54:41,882 --> 01:54:43,484
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1481
01:54:43,508 --> 01:54:47,470
Take it easy.

1482
01:54:56,021 --> 01:54:57,982
Rata Alada.

1483
01:55:02,235 --> 01:55:04,088
A falcon has wings, too.

1484
01:55:04,112 --> 01:55:06,698
Falcone is the rat?

1485
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:20,730
Falcone works for you guys?

1486
01:55:20,754 --> 01:55:24,008
The mayor? The DA?

1487
01:55:26,217 --> 01:55:28,636
No.

1488
01:55:30,596 --> 01:55:32,473
We work for him.

1489
01:55:32,808 --> 01:55:34,368
Everybody does.

1490
01:55:34,392 --> 01:55:35,369
How?

1491
01:55:35,393 --> 01:55:37,454
Through Renewal.

1492
01:55:37,478 --> 01:55:38,497
Renewal is everything.

1493
01:55:38,521 --> 01:55:40,875
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1494
01:55:40,899 --> 01:55:41,751
After Thomas Wayne died,

1495
01:55:41,775 --> 01:55:43,962
they all went after it
like vultures.

1496
01:55:43,986 --> 01:55:48,049
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1497
01:55:48,073 --> 01:55:50,760
It was perfect
for making bribes,

1498
01:55:50,784 --> 01:55:51,510
laundering money.

1499
01:55:51,534 --> 01:55:53,847
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1500
01:55:53,871 --> 01:55:55,765
Everybody got a piece.

1501
01:55:55,789 --> 01:55:58,374
But Falcone wanted more.

1502
01:55:59,001 --> 01:56:03,546
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1503
01:56:03,714 --> 01:56:05,984
He'd rat out
his drops operation,

1504
01:56:06,008 --> 01:56:09,111
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1505
01:56:09,135 --> 01:56:11,614
then install them all
as his puppets.

1506
01:56:11,638 --> 01:56:15,433
You think this goddamn
election matters?

1507
01:56:16,309 --> 01:56:18,454
Falcone's the mayor.

1508
01:56:18,478 --> 01:56:21,666
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1509
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:23,292
Come on, Vengeance.

1510
01:56:23,316 --> 01:56:25,837
Let's go kill
that son of a bitch.

1511
01:56:25,861 --> 01:56:27,714
This creep too.
Let's finish this.

1512
01:56:27,738 --> 01:56:28,965
-Oh, God!
-No!

1513
01:56:30,448 --> 01:56:31,551
We'll get him.

1514
01:56:31,575 --> 01:56:33,803
-But not that way.
-There is no other way!

1515
01:56:33,827 --> 01:56:37,222
-He owns the city!
-Cross that line,

1516
01:56:37,246 --> 01:56:39,516
you'll become just like him.

1517
01:56:39,541 --> 01:56:40,852
Listen to me.

1518
01:56:40,876 --> 01:56:43,670
Don't throw your life away.

1519
01:56:49,425 --> 01:56:51,553
Don't worry, honey.

1520
01:56:53,931 --> 01:56:54,783
I got nine of 'em.

1521
01:56:54,807 --> 01:56:58,184
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1522
01:56:58,519 --> 01:57:01,730
Oh, God!

1523
01:57:08,946 --> 01:57:10,422
She won't
get out of there alive.

1524
01:57:10,446 --> 01:57:12,801
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1525
01:57:12,825 --> 01:57:16,327
-I have to stop her.
-Don't you mean "we"?

1526
01:57:16,829 --> 01:57:18,890
I gotta do this my way.

1527
01:57:18,914 --> 01:57:20,541
And then what?

1528
01:57:20,666 --> 01:57:22,644
We do what Riddler said.

1529
01:57:22,668 --> 01:57:25,253
Bring the rat into the light.

1530
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:02,224
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1531
01:58:02,248 --> 01:58:04,436
He ain't seein' nobody
tonight.

1532
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:06,712
Tell him it's about Annika.

1533
01:58:09,506 --> 01:58:11,316
Hey!

1534
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,193
Look who it is, huh?

1535
01:58:12,217 --> 01:58:14,737
-Sorry to bother you.
-Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1536
01:58:14,761 --> 01:58:17,657
I was just hoping I could
talk to you for a minute?

1537
01:58:17,681 --> 01:58:19,725
Absolutely.

1538
01:58:21,018 --> 01:58:21,911
Alone?

1539
01:58:38,702 --> 01:58:39,220
Hey!

1540
01:58:49,463 --> 01:58:50,815
I'm just so worried.

1541
01:58:50,839 --> 01:58:53,550
I... I don't know
where she is.

1542
01:58:53,884 --> 01:58:57,197
And I know that
you're a very important man.

1543
01:58:57,221 --> 01:59:00,992
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1544
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:06,247
because she's been gone
so long, I'm beginning to...

1545
01:59:06,272 --> 01:59:08,875
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1546
01:59:08,899 --> 01:59:11,294
-I'm so sorry.
-I understand. Here.

1547
01:59:11,318 --> 01:59:15,197
No, that's okay,
I have a tissue.

1548
01:59:18,575 --> 01:59:19,969
-Mr. Falcone?
-Vinnie!

1549
01:59:19,993 --> 01:59:21,804
-Didn't I tell you?
-I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1550
01:59:21,828 --> 01:59:25,207
I really think you're gonna
want to see this.

1551
01:59:26,292 --> 01:59:28,229
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1552
01:59:28,253 --> 01:59:30,255
I'll be right back.

1553
01:59:45,018 --> 01:59:45,662
Holy shit.

1554
01:59:45,686 --> 01:59:47,372
That recording,
provided to GC-1

1555
01:59:47,396 --> 01:59:50,292
by Lieutenant James Gordon
of the Gotham PD.

1556
01:59:50,316 --> 01:59:51,252
And we should warn you,

1557
01:59:51,276 --> 01:59:52,835
the contents
are extremely graphic,

1558
01:59:52,859 --> 01:59:55,797
and some of you
may find it disturbing.

1559
01:59:55,821 --> 01:59:58,132
He just said

1560
01:59:58,157 --> 02:00:00,219
they all made a deal with you.

1561
02:00:00,243 --> 02:00:01,344
Oh. Hmm.

1562
02:00:01,368 --> 02:00:03,471
He told you
about that, huh?

1563
02:00:03,495 --> 02:00:05,014
The deal.

1564
02:00:05,038 --> 02:00:05,807
He said

1565
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:09,477
you gave some information
on some drops thing,

1566
02:00:09,501 --> 02:00:12,063
and that's how
he became mayor.

1567
02:00:12,087 --> 02:00:15,483
He said you were
a very important man.

1568
02:00:15,507 --> 02:00:17,176
Right.

1569
02:00:17,509 --> 02:00:20,512
Hmm. Okay.

1570
02:00:26,144 --> 02:00:29,581
Revelations
of Mr. Falcone's secret role

1571
02:00:29,605 --> 02:00:31,523
as a mafia informant...

1572
02:00:31,648 --> 02:00:33,359
Hey, Dad.

1573
02:00:34,110 --> 02:00:35,212
What?

1574
02:00:35,236 --> 02:00:38,071
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1575
02:00:39,365 --> 02:00:41,450
You remember her?

1576
02:00:42,576 --> 02:00:44,078
Yeah.

1577
02:00:45,121 --> 02:00:46,622
Just...

1578
02:00:47,748 --> 02:00:49,059
Just put down the gun, honey.

1579
02:00:49,083 --> 02:00:50,959
This is for my mother.

1580
02:01:47,557 --> 02:01:49,310
I see him!

1581
02:02:32,353 --> 02:02:35,064
You don't think this hurts me?

1582
02:02:37,566 --> 02:02:41,946
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1583
02:02:57,586 --> 02:03:00,131
You made me do this.

1584
02:03:00,756 --> 02:03:03,342
Just like your mother.

1585
02:03:08,722 --> 02:03:10,682
He has to pay!

1586
02:03:13,519 --> 02:03:15,164
You don't have to pay
with him.

1587
02:03:18,775 --> 02:03:20,860
You paid enough.

1588
02:03:54,936 --> 02:03:55,496
Jesus.

1589
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:58,207
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1590
02:03:58,231 --> 02:03:59,624
You think
you're gonna scare me

1591
02:03:59,648 --> 02:04:01,126
with that mask and that cape?

1592
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:03,796
I'm gonna start crying,
and all of a sudden,

1593
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:05,588
some big secret's comin' out?

1594
02:04:05,612 --> 02:04:07,590
Let me tell you something.

1595
02:04:07,614 --> 02:04:09,218
Whatever I know,

1596
02:04:09,242 --> 02:04:11,136
whatever I've done,

1597
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:13,972
it's all going with me

1598
02:04:13,996 --> 02:04:16,290
to my grave.

1599
02:04:25,675 --> 02:04:28,761
What, are you with Zorro
over here?

1600
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:32,682
Don't you know you boys
in blue work for me?

1601
02:04:39,313 --> 02:04:42,125
I guess
we don't all work for you.

1602
02:04:50,783 --> 02:04:52,803
You have the right
to remain silent.

1603
02:04:52,827 --> 02:04:55,848
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1604
02:04:55,872 --> 02:04:56,765
in a court of law.

1605
02:04:56,789 --> 02:04:58,601
You have the right
to an attorney.

1606
02:04:58,625 --> 02:04:59,518
If you cannot afford one,

1607
02:04:59,542 --> 02:05:01,353
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1608
02:05:01,377 --> 02:05:04,171
Do you understand
these rights?

1609
02:05:04,922 --> 02:05:07,216
Do you understand?

1610
02:05:08,594 --> 02:05:09,444
Yeah.

1611
02:05:09,468 --> 02:05:11,363
I'll see you when I walk out.

1612
02:05:11,387 --> 02:05:12,615
With these rights in mind,

1613
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:14,366
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1614
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:16,225
Goddamn rat.

1615
02:05:17,603 --> 02:05:18,370
What'd you say?

1616
02:05:18,394 --> 02:05:21,355
Enjoy your night
at Blackgate, Carmine.

1617
02:05:21,689 --> 02:05:22,584
Probably be your last.

1618
02:05:22,608 --> 02:05:26,503
Oh-ho! So you're
a big man now, Oz, huh?

1619
02:05:26,527 --> 02:05:27,671
Maybe I am.

1620
02:05:27,695 --> 02:05:28,380
Really, Oz?

1621
02:05:28,404 --> 02:05:33,553
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1622
02:05:33,577 --> 02:05:34,637
I'll spray paint your ass!

1623
02:05:38,331 --> 02:05:39,892
What are you doing?
It wasn't me!

1624
02:05:39,916 --> 02:05:43,085
I didn't shoot!
I didn't shoot!

1625
02:05:43,629 --> 02:05:44,522
Get your hands off of me!

1626
02:06:04,524 --> 02:06:07,401
"Bring him into the light.

1627
02:06:09,862 --> 02:06:12,382
And you'll find
where I'm at."

1628
02:06:12,406 --> 02:06:13,216
There!

1629
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:15,344
The shots came from up there!

1630
02:06:16,953 --> 02:06:17,721
It's Riddler.

1631
02:06:19,789 --> 02:06:21,058
Gage, on me.

1632
02:06:21,082 --> 02:06:21,975
Martinez, around back.

1633
02:06:21,999 --> 02:06:24,670
Nobody gets in there,
nobody gets out!

1634
02:07:38,577 --> 02:07:40,328
He's gone.

1635
02:07:49,086 --> 02:07:51,023
He's been here
this whole time.

1636
02:07:51,047 --> 02:07:52,983
-Lieutenant. Martinez.
-Yeah?

1637
02:07:53,007 --> 02:07:54,610
Lieutenant,
we got a witness here,

1638
02:07:54,634 --> 02:07:56,069
says she saw someone
coming down

1639
02:07:56,093 --> 02:07:57,572
the fire escape
right after the shot.

1640
02:07:57,596 --> 02:07:59,240
She said he went
into the corner diner.

1641
02:07:59,264 --> 02:08:03,244
The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.

1642
02:08:18,658 --> 02:08:21,578
Police! Hands up!

1643
02:08:23,246 --> 02:08:25,891
He said put
your goddamn hands up,

1644
02:08:25,915 --> 02:08:27,851
you son of a bitch.

1645
02:08:45,935 --> 02:08:49,147
I just ordered
a slice of pumpkin pie.

1646
02:08:51,316 --> 02:08:53,043
Stay still!

1647
02:08:53,067 --> 02:08:54,486
Now!

1648
02:09:22,180 --> 02:09:23,866
Which one is you?

1649
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:26,494
You tell me.

1650
02:09:26,518 --> 02:09:28,770
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1651
02:09:30,605 --> 02:09:32,875
Get that son of a bitch
out of here!

1652
02:09:46,872 --> 02:09:48,391
...where
even murdered mayor

1653
02:09:48,415 --> 02:09:49,767
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife
and son

1654
02:09:49,791 --> 02:09:53,354
have gathered in an emotional
show of city unity.

1655
02:09:53,378 --> 02:09:54,272
Our Dan O'Neil is live

1656
02:09:54,296 --> 02:09:56,274
inside Real's headquarters
right now...

1657
02:09:56,298 --> 02:09:57,757
Hey.

1658
02:10:21,281 --> 02:10:22,800
What are all these diaries?

1659
02:10:22,824 --> 02:10:25,052
They're ledgers.
He's got thousands.

1660
02:10:25,076 --> 02:10:28,806
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1661
02:10:28,830 --> 02:10:30,641
Got something back
on one of the IDs.

1662
02:10:30,665 --> 02:10:32,727
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1663
02:10:32,751 --> 02:10:34,687
-He's a forensic accountant.
-Accountant?

1664
02:10:34,711 --> 02:10:37,523
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1665
02:10:37,547 --> 02:10:40,318
What about chain of evidence?

1666
02:10:40,342 --> 02:10:42,302
You should see this.

1667
02:10:47,515 --> 02:10:49,768
He's wearing gloves.

1668
02:10:50,477 --> 02:10:52,163
"Friday, July 16th.

1669
02:10:52,187 --> 02:10:56,459
My life has been a cruel
riddle I could not solve,

1670
02:10:56,483 --> 02:10:59,754
suffocating my mind,
no escape.

1671
02:10:59,778 --> 02:11:00,755
But then, today, I saw it.

1672
02:11:00,779 --> 02:11:06,368
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1673
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:08,387
'Renewal.'

1674
02:11:08,411 --> 02:11:10,681
The empty promise
they sold to me

1675
02:11:10,705 --> 02:11:12,893
as a child in that orphanage.

1676
02:11:12,917 --> 02:11:15,811
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1677
02:11:15,835 --> 02:11:19,315
My whole life has been
preparing me for this.

1678
02:11:19,339 --> 02:11:22,026
The moment
when I would learn the truth.

1679
02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:23,778
When I could finally
strike back

1680
02:11:23,802 --> 02:11:25,864
and expose their lies."

1681
02:11:25,888 --> 02:11:29,910
"If you want people to
understand, really understand,

1682
02:11:29,934 --> 02:11:32,662
you can't just
give them the answers.

1683
02:11:32,686 --> 02:11:33,663
You have to confront them,

1684
02:11:33,687 --> 02:11:36,666
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1685
02:11:36,690 --> 02:11:38,835
just like they tortured me.

1686
02:11:38,859 --> 02:11:42,654
I know now
what I must become."

1687
02:11:45,156 --> 02:11:46,384
Jesus.

1688
02:11:51,705 --> 02:11:54,684
I don't think that rat
likes you, man.

1689
02:11:54,708 --> 02:11:55,685
This one's not a rat.

1690
02:12:12,852 --> 02:12:14,770
What is that?

1691
02:12:45,258 --> 02:12:47,029
Some kind of pry tool?

1692
02:12:47,053 --> 02:12:48,112
Is it a chisel?

1693
02:12:48,136 --> 02:12:49,698
It's a murder weapon.

1694
02:12:49,722 --> 02:12:51,282
He killed Mitchell with it.

1695
02:12:51,306 --> 02:12:53,576
The edge will match
the floorboard impression

1696
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:55,477
in the mayor's study.

1697
02:13:03,568 --> 02:13:05,463
"My confession"?

1698
02:13:05,487 --> 02:13:06,339
What's he confessing to?

1699
02:13:06,363 --> 02:13:08,717
He already told us
he killed Mitchell.

1700
02:13:08,741 --> 02:13:09,885
This isn't over.

1701
02:13:09,909 --> 02:13:10,761
Oh, man.

1702
02:13:10,785 --> 02:13:12,136
He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1703
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:15,556
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1704
02:13:22,295 --> 02:13:25,441
His final post was last night.

1705
02:13:25,465 --> 02:13:26,150
Some video.

1706
02:13:26,174 --> 02:13:28,569
Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1707
02:13:28,593 --> 02:13:29,696
Can you get in?

1708
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:31,447
Copying his drive now.

1709
02:13:31,471 --> 02:13:35,159
Take some time,
but we'll get in.

1710
02:13:45,527 --> 02:13:49,698
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1711
02:13:50,574 --> 02:13:53,011
"The Truth Unmasked."

1712
02:13:53,035 --> 02:13:55,537
I think I'm his last target.

1713
02:13:57,706 --> 02:13:58,474
You?

1714
02:13:58,498 --> 02:14:01,627
Maybe this is all
coming to an end.

1715
02:14:01,752 --> 02:14:03,396
What is?

1716
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:04,689
The Batman.

1717
02:14:10,343 --> 02:14:11,971
Yeah?

1718
02:14:22,815 --> 02:14:24,482
Right.

1719
02:14:26,193 --> 02:14:31,322
Riddler's asking for you.
At Arkham.

1720
02:14:38,038 --> 02:14:40,248
You're a good cop.

1721
02:15:03,354 --> 02:15:06,585
I told you
I'd see you in hell.

1722
02:15:06,609 --> 02:15:09,336
What do you
want from me?

1723
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:11,047
"Want"?

1724
02:15:11,071 --> 02:15:12,256
If only you knew how long

1725
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:15,659
I've been waiting
for this day.

1726
02:15:16,118 --> 02:15:17,971
For this moment.

1727
02:15:17,995 --> 02:15:22,017
I've been invisible
my whole life.

1728
02:15:22,041 --> 02:15:25,920
I guess I won't be anymore,
will I?

1729
02:15:26,545 --> 02:15:28,940
They'll remember me now.

1730
02:15:28,964 --> 02:15:31,800
They'll remember
both of us.

1731
02:15:41,602 --> 02:15:44,146
Bruce...

1732
02:15:46,565 --> 02:15:48,859
Wayne.

1733
02:15:50,569 --> 02:15:54,990
Bruce...

1734
02:15:55,950 --> 02:15:59,286
Wayne.

1735
02:16:09,171 --> 02:16:12,925
You know,
I was there that day.

1736
02:16:14,635 --> 02:16:16,029
The day the great Thomas Wayne

1737
02:16:16,053 --> 02:16:18,031
announced
he was running for mayor,

1738
02:16:18,055 --> 02:16:21,350
made all those promises.

1739
02:16:22,518 --> 02:16:24,120
Well, a week later
he was dead,

1740
02:16:24,144 --> 02:16:26,998
and everybody
just forgot about us.

1741
02:16:27,022 --> 02:16:31,419
All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.

1742
02:16:31,443 --> 02:16:36,091
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.

1743
02:16:36,115 --> 02:16:38,158
Orphan.

1744
02:16:42,580 --> 02:16:46,434
Living in some tower
over the park

1745
02:16:46,458 --> 02:16:48,728
isn't being an orphan.

1746
02:16:48,752 --> 02:16:54,859
Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.

1747
02:16:54,883 --> 02:16:57,220
Don't you tell me.

1748
02:16:58,679 --> 02:17:02,033
Do you know
what being an orphan is?

1749
02:17:02,057 --> 02:17:05,329
It's 30 kids to a room.

1750
02:17:05,353 --> 02:17:08,498
Twelve years old
and already a drophead,

1751
02:17:08,522 --> 02:17:10,816
numbing the pain.

1752
02:17:11,650 --> 02:17:12,627
You wake up screaming

1753
02:17:12,651 --> 02:17:16,881
with rats
chewing your fingers.

1754
02:17:16,905 --> 02:17:20,719
And every winter
one of the babies die

1755
02:17:20,743 --> 02:17:23,871
because it's so cold.

1756
02:17:24,496 --> 02:17:27,750
But, oh, no.

1757
02:17:29,336 --> 02:17:31,646
Let's talk
about the billionaire

1758
02:17:31,670 --> 02:17:32,772
with the lying,
dead daddy,

1759
02:17:32,796 --> 02:17:36,235
because at least the money
makes it go down easy.

1760
02:17:36,259 --> 02:17:37,926
Doesn't it?

1761
02:17:38,802 --> 02:17:41,430
Bruce...

1762
02:17:42,014 --> 02:17:44,392
Wayne.

1763
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:51,149
He's the only one
we didn't get.

1764
02:17:53,109 --> 02:17:57,672
But we got the rest of 'em,
didn't we?

1765
02:17:57,696 --> 02:18:03,035
All those slick,
sleazy, phony pricks.

1766
02:18:05,663 --> 02:18:07,332
God.

1767
02:18:07,665 --> 02:18:09,625
Look at you.

1768
02:18:10,501 --> 02:18:12,646
Your mask is amazing.

1769
02:18:12,670 --> 02:18:16,150
I wish you could've
seen me in mine.

1770
02:18:16,174 --> 02:18:16,941
Ain't it funny?

1771
02:18:16,965 --> 02:18:19,653
All everyone wants to do
is unmask you,

1772
02:18:19,677 --> 02:18:22,430
but they're missing the point.

1773
02:18:23,056 --> 02:18:25,575
You and I both know,

1774
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:28,287
I'm looking at the real you
right now.

1775
02:18:28,311 --> 02:18:31,040
My mask allowed me
to be myself,

1776
02:18:31,064 --> 02:18:32,540
completely.

1777
02:18:32,564 --> 02:18:34,733
No shame,

1778
02:18:35,025 --> 02:18:35,960
no limits.

1779
02:18:35,984 --> 02:18:38,405
Why did you write me?

1780
02:18:38,529 --> 02:18:39,714
What do you mean?

1781
02:18:39,738 --> 02:18:41,466
All those cards.

1782
02:18:41,490 --> 02:18:42,592
I told you,

1783
02:18:42,616 --> 02:18:44,178
we've been
doing this together.

1784
02:18:44,202 --> 02:18:45,096
You're a part of this.

1785
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:46,721
We didn't do
anything together.

1786
02:18:46,745 --> 02:18:47,472
We did.

1787
02:18:47,496 --> 02:18:48,432
What did we just do?

1788
02:18:48,456 --> 02:18:51,102
I asked you to bring him
into the light, and you did.

1789
02:18:51,126 --> 02:18:52,395
We're such a good team.

1790
02:18:52,419 --> 02:18:53,312
We're not a team.

1791
02:18:53,336 --> 02:18:55,398
I never could have gotten him
out of there.

1792
02:18:55,422 --> 02:18:57,691
I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.

1793
02:18:57,715 --> 02:19:01,404
I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.

1794
02:19:01,428 --> 02:19:03,697
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1795
02:19:03,721 --> 02:19:04,864
You gave me that.

1796
02:19:04,888 --> 02:19:05,824
I gave you nothing.

1797
02:19:05,848 --> 02:19:08,035
You showed me
what was possible.

1798
02:19:08,059 --> 02:19:11,621
You showed me
all it takes is fear

1799
02:19:11,645 --> 02:19:13,707
and a little focused violence.

1800
02:19:13,731 --> 02:19:14,874
You inspired me.

1801
02:19:14,898 --> 02:19:17,609
You're out
of your goddamn mind.

1802
02:19:18,194 --> 02:19:18,837
What?

1803
02:19:18,861 --> 02:19:21,257
This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.

1804
02:19:21,281 --> 02:19:22,507
How can you say that?

1805
02:19:22,531 --> 02:19:24,135
You think
you'll be remembered?

1806
02:19:24,159 --> 02:19:26,178
You're a pathetic
psychopath,

1807
02:19:26,202 --> 02:19:27,887
-begging for attention.
-No.

1808
02:19:27,911 --> 02:19:29,432
You're gonna die alone
in Arkham.

1809
02:19:29,456 --> 02:19:32,959
-No. No, no, no!
-A nobody!

1810
02:19:34,252 --> 02:19:36,545
No!

1811
02:19:37,964 --> 02:19:39,649
Ahhh!

1812
02:19:39,673 --> 02:19:43,677
This is not how
this was supposed to go!

1813
02:19:44,179 --> 02:19:47,366
Ahhh!

1814
02:19:47,390 --> 02:19:50,953
I had it all planned out!

1815
02:19:50,977 --> 02:19:53,080
We were gonna
be safe here.

1816
02:19:53,104 --> 02:19:57,042
We could watch
the whole thing together.

1817
02:19:57,066 --> 02:19:58,210
Watch what?

1818
02:19:58,234 --> 02:20:00,611
Everything!

1819
02:20:08,119 --> 02:20:10,538
It was all there.

1820
02:20:11,289 --> 02:20:15,043
You mean,
you didn't figure it out?

1821
02:20:17,837 --> 02:20:23,259
Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.

1822
02:20:23,927 --> 02:20:26,989
I guess I gave you
too much credit.

1823
02:20:27,013 --> 02:20:28,282
What have you done?

1824
02:20:28,306 --> 02:20:34,686
What's black and blue
and dead all over?

1825
02:20:37,023 --> 02:20:39,317
You.

1826
02:20:39,608 --> 02:20:43,154
If you think you can stop
what's coming.

1827
02:20:43,654 --> 02:20:46,091

1835
02:21:47,468 --> 02:21:49,679
What are you doing in here?

1836
02:22:05,945 --> 02:22:10,199
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1837
02:22:15,496 --> 02:22:18,726
Boy, this guy's
a real nutjob, huh?

1838
02:22:18,750 --> 02:22:22,837
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1839
02:22:26,299 --> 02:22:29,403
My uncle's a...
He's an installer.

You know, it's a...
Oh, you know.

Huh.

1843
02:23:08,049 --> 02:23:10,027
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1844

Hey, guys.

1847
02:23:44,461 --> 02:23:46,523
Uh, thanks
for all the comments,

1848
02:23:46,547 --> 02:23:48,566
and, uh, a special thanks
to everyone

1849
02:23:48,590 --> 02:23:50,443
for the tips
on detonators.

1850
02:23:50,467 --> 02:23:51,151
Detonators?

1851
02:23:51,175 --> 02:23:52,570
I just want to say
this will be

1852
02:23:52,594 --> 02:23:57,181
my last postfor a
little while, and, uh...

1853
02:23:58,099 --> 02:24:00,620
what this community
has meant to me

1854
02:24:00,644 --> 02:24:04,499
these weeks,
these months,

1855
02:24:04,523 --> 02:24:07,942
let's just say
none of us...

1856
02:24:08,818 --> 02:24:11,780
is alone anymore. Okay?

1857
02:24:12,030 --> 02:24:13,466
Jesus.

1858
02:24:17,201 --> 02:24:22,206
Tomorrow's Election Day.

1859
02:24:22,708 --> 02:24:25,478
And Bella Real will win.

1860
02:24:25,502 --> 02:24:28,398
She promised real change.

1861
02:24:28,422 --> 02:24:30,858
But we know the truth,
don't we?

1862
02:24:30,882 --> 02:24:33,277
You've seen
Gotham's true face now.

1863
02:24:33,301 --> 02:24:35,363
Together, we've
unmasked it.

1864
02:24:35,387 --> 02:24:37,782
Its corruption, its perversion

1865
02:24:37,806 --> 02:24:42,244
masquerading
under the guise of renewal.

1866
02:24:42,268 --> 02:24:47,065
But unmasking
is not enough.

1867
02:24:47,775 --> 02:24:52,212
The day of judgment
is finally upon us.

1868
02:24:52,236 --> 02:24:55,741
And now it is time

1869
02:24:56,074 --> 02:24:58,470
for retribution.

1870
02:24:58,494 --> 02:25:01,306
I've parked seven vans

1871
02:25:01,330 --> 02:25:04,666
all along the
city seawall.

1872
02:25:04,999 --> 02:25:06,935
And on the big night,

1873
02:25:06,959 --> 02:25:10,088
they
will go boom.

1874
02:25:23,101 --> 02:25:26,355
Boom!

1875
02:25:29,858 --> 02:25:32,736
Boom!

1876
02:25:34,153 --> 02:25:35,964
When the vans blow,

1877
02:25:35,988 --> 02:25:38,802
the flooding
will happen so fast,

1878
02:25:38,826 --> 02:25:41,970
evacuation
will not be an option.

1879
02:25:41,994 --> 02:25:44,766
Those who are not
washed away

1880
02:25:44,790 --> 02:25:47,519
will race through the streets
in terror.

1881
02:25:47,543 --> 02:25:49,771
Call Gordon.

1882
02:25:49,795 --> 02:25:52,147
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1883
02:25:52,881 --> 02:25:55,652
As breaking news
hits higher ground

1884
02:25:55,676 --> 02:25:57,069
in Gotham Square Garden,

1885
02:25:57,093 --> 02:26:00,198
celebrations
will turn to panic,

1886
02:26:00,222 --> 02:26:01,574
as the venue becomes

1887
02:26:01,598 --> 02:26:05,370
the city's shelter
of last resort.

1888
02:26:06,102 --> 02:26:11,275
And that's where
all of you come in.

1889
02:26:15,863 --> 02:26:19,551
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

1890
02:26:19,575 --> 02:26:22,554
The pigs will have me
in their custody,

1891
02:26:22,578 --> 02:26:24,054
but that's okay.

1892
02:26:24,078 --> 02:26:29,017
Because then
it will be your turn.

1893
02:26:29,041 --> 02:26:33,523
You'll be there, waiting.

1894
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:46,494
It's time for the lies
to finally end.

1895
02:26:46,518 --> 02:26:51,833
False
promises of renewal?

1896
02:26:51,857 --> 02:26:52,458
Change?

1897
02:26:52,482 --> 02:26:55,961
We'll give them real,
real change now.

1898
02:26:55,985 --> 02:27:00,048
We've spent our lives
in this wretched place,

1899
02:27:00,073 --> 02:27:02,135
suffering!

1900
02:27:02,159 --> 02:27:03,928
Wondering, "Why us?"

1901
02:27:03,952 --> 02:27:07,891
Now they will spend their
last moments wondering,

1902
02:27:07,915 --> 02:27:09,642
why them?

1903
02:27:09,666 --> 02:27:13,045
I can't get through!
The lines are down.

1904
02:27:17,716 --> 02:27:20,153
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1905
02:27:20,177 --> 02:27:21,529
I'm just trying
to get out of town, man!

1906
02:27:21,553 --> 02:27:24,824
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1907
02:27:24,848 --> 02:27:26,242
You're gonna have to go
inside the Garden

1908
02:27:26,266 --> 02:27:28,203
with everyone else.

1909
02:27:36,235 --> 02:27:38,296
-Lieutenant, who's in charge?
-I really don't know.

1910
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:40,256
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1911
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:42,133
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1912
02:27:42,157 --> 02:27:43,176
We got an active situation.

1913
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:44,719
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1914
02:27:44,743 --> 02:27:46,596
and get the mayor-elect out
of here, now. Where is she?

1915
02:27:46,620 --> 02:27:48,264
-I can take you there.
-Come!

1916
02:28:23,323 --> 02:28:25,301
If we don't close
the doors, we're gonna have...

1917
02:28:25,325 --> 02:28:26,427
-MCU.
-...huge problems.

1918
02:28:26,451 --> 02:28:27,845
The water's
already started to breach.

1919
02:28:27,869 --> 02:28:29,389
I thought this was a shelter
of last resort.

1920
02:28:29,413 --> 02:28:30,306
Yeah, for a hurricane,

1921
02:28:30,330 --> 02:28:31,766
but not if the whole seawall
comes down.

1922
02:28:31,790 --> 02:28:33,518
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1923
02:28:33,542 --> 02:28:34,937
All right.
I'll go calm down the crowd

1924
02:28:34,961 --> 02:28:37,063
-so we can get everyone in.
-It's not safe for you here.

1925
02:28:37,087 --> 02:28:38,314
We need to get you out,
Ms. Real.

1926
02:28:38,338 --> 02:28:40,400
-I'm not going anywhere.
-We're under attack, ma'am.

1927
02:28:40,424 --> 02:28:42,068
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1928
02:28:42,092 --> 02:28:45,071
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing,

1929
02:28:45,095 --> 02:28:45,906
but I'm not.

1930
02:28:45,930 --> 02:28:48,307
-Excuse me.
-Ma'am...

1931
02:28:52,644 --> 02:28:53,579
Everyone, everyone,

1932
02:28:53,603 --> 02:28:55,665
if I could just
get your attention.

1933
02:28:55,689 --> 02:28:59,318
Please!
I just need your attention!

1934
02:29:14,583 --> 02:29:16,293
You're okay!

1935
02:30:46,050 --> 02:30:49,029
Hey! Hey!
How do I get up there?

1936
02:30:49,053 --> 02:30:50,972
Follow me, sir.

1937
02:33:00,226 --> 02:33:01,912
No, no. It's okay.

1938
02:33:01,936 --> 02:33:02,579
It's okay.

1939
02:33:02,603 --> 02:33:05,773
It's okay.

1940
02:33:06,607 --> 02:33:09,527
It's done now. It's done.

1941
02:33:11,654 --> 02:33:13,531
It's over.

1942
02:34:08,210 --> 02:34:09,146
Hey!

1943
02:34:09,170 --> 02:34:11,648
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1944
02:34:11,672 --> 02:34:14,277
Take it easy.

1945
02:34:14,301 --> 02:34:15,444
Easy.

1946
02:34:43,913 --> 02:34:45,498
Jesus.

1947
02:34:54,548 --> 02:34:57,009
Who the hell are you?

1948
02:35:00,805 --> 02:35:02,224
Me?

1949
02:35:04,767 --> 02:35:06,727
I'm Vengeance.

1950
02:38:38,148 --> 02:38:40,918
Wednesday,
November 6th.

1951
02:38:44,112 --> 02:38:46,823
The city is underwater.

1952
02:38:48,325 --> 02:38:51,119
The National
Guard is coming.

1953
02:38:52,245 --> 02:38:55,141
Martial law is in effect,

1954
02:38:55,165 --> 02:38:58,251
but the criminal element
never sleeps.

1955
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:03,482
Looting and lawlessness
will be rampant

1956
02:39:03,506 --> 02:39:07,236
in the parts of the city
no one can get to.

1957
02:39:07,260 --> 02:39:10,406
I can already see
things will get worse

1958
02:39:10,430 --> 02:39:12,474
before they get better.

1959
02:39:13,725 --> 02:39:18,563
And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.

1960
02:39:19,105 --> 02:39:21,125
We will rebuild.

1961
02:39:21,149 --> 02:39:23,127
But not just our city.

1962
02:39:23,151 --> 02:39:25,755
We must rebuild people's faith

1963
02:39:25,779 --> 02:39:27,548
in our institutions,

1964
02:39:27,572 --> 02:39:29,884
in our elected officials,

1965
02:39:29,908 --> 02:39:31,010
in each other.

1966
02:39:31,034 --> 02:39:34,805
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1967
02:39:38,959 --> 02:39:41,962
I'm starting
to see now.

1968
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:45,590
I have had an
effect here...

1969
02:39:46,676 --> 02:39:49,594
but not the
one I intended.

1970
02:39:50,721 --> 02:39:55,016
Vengeance
won't change the past,

1971
02:39:55,558 --> 02:39:58,729
mine or anyone else's.

1972
02:40:00,355 --> 02:40:03,191
I have to become more.

1973
02:40:05,485 --> 02:40:07,673
People need hope.

1974
02:40:07,697 --> 02:40:11,324
To know someone's
out there for them.

1975
02:40:14,285 --> 02:40:16,747
The city's angry,

1976
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:19,040
scarred,

1977
02:40:19,374 --> 02:40:21,209
like me.

1978
02:40:22,377 --> 02:40:25,398
Our scars can destroy us.

1979
02:40:25,422 --> 02:40:29,509
Even after the physical wounds
have healed.

1980
02:40:30,301 --> 02:40:32,887
But if we survive them,

1981
02:40:33,597 --> 02:40:36,266
they can transform us.

1982
02:40:37,183 --> 02:40:40,061
They can give
us the power

1983
02:40:40,353 --> 02:40:42,523
to endure...

1984
02:40:42,939 --> 02:40:46,026
and the strength
to fight.

1985
02:40:47,570 --> 02:40:49,422
We are live.
As you can see,

1986
02:40:49,446 --> 02:40:53,050
the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden,

1987
02:40:53,074 --> 02:40:54,135
helping to save the lives

1988
02:40:54,159 --> 02:40:56,387
of hundreds of victims.

1989
02:40:56,411 --> 02:40:57,514
And now as
first responders

1990
02:40:57,538 --> 02:40:59,306
desperately scramble
to help the injured,

1991
02:40:59,330 --> 02:41:01,518
a mysterious masked man
emerges,

1992
02:41:01,542 --> 02:41:04,521
heroically pulling the
victimsright through that skylight...

1993
02:41:04,545 --> 02:41:08,006
Isn't that just terrible?

1994
02:41:08,923 --> 02:41:09,984
Him...

1995
02:41:10,008 --> 02:41:15,556
raining on your parade
like that?

1996
02:41:19,225 --> 02:41:21,978
What is it they say?

1997
02:41:22,353 --> 02:41:25,315
"One day you're on top...

1998
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:28,527
the next,

1999
02:41:29,319 --> 02:41:31,673
you're a clown."

2000
02:41:33,657 --> 02:41:35,325
Well...

2001
02:41:35,743 --> 02:41:39,388
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

2002
02:41:41,331 --> 02:41:44,918
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

2003
02:41:45,628 --> 02:41:48,046
You did so well.

2004
02:41:51,925 --> 02:41:53,552
And you know,

2005
02:41:54,260 --> 02:41:58,432
Gotham loves a comeback story.

2006
02:42:07,691 --> 02:42:09,210
Who are you?

2007
02:42:09,234 --> 02:42:12,822
Well,
that's the question,

2008
02:42:13,572 --> 02:42:15,198
isn't it?

2009
02:42:17,701 --> 02:42:20,704
Riddle me this...

2010
02:42:22,122 --> 02:42:24,975
"The less of them you have,

2011
02:42:24,999 --> 02:42:29,672
the more one is worth."

2012
02:42:34,635 --> 02:42:36,846
A friend.

2013
02:43:02,496 --> 02:43:04,266
You're leaving.

2014
02:43:04,290 --> 02:43:06,040
Jesus.

2015
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,545
Don't you ever just say hello?

2016
02:43:13,757 --> 02:43:15,885
Where will you go?

2017
02:43:16,594 --> 02:43:19,573
I don't know. Upstate.

2018
02:43:19,597 --> 02:43:21,932
Bludhaven, maybe.

2019
02:43:22,391 --> 02:43:23,809
Why?

2020
02:43:24,226 --> 02:43:26,228
You asking me to stay?

2021
02:43:31,901 --> 02:43:34,296
You know this place
is never gonna change.

2022
02:43:34,320 --> 02:43:37,507
With Carmine gone, it's only
gonna get worse for you.

2023
02:43:37,531 --> 02:43:40,284
There's gonna be a power grab.

2024
02:43:41,159 --> 02:43:42,870
It'll be bloody.

2025
02:43:42,994 --> 02:43:44,705
I know.

2026
02:43:45,748 --> 02:43:47,267
But the city can change.

2027
02:43:47,291 --> 02:43:48,959
It won't.

2028
02:43:49,418 --> 02:43:50,144
I have to try.

2029
02:43:50,169 --> 02:43:52,880
It's gonna kill you
eventually. You know that.

2030
02:43:54,673 --> 02:43:56,300
Listen.

2031
02:43:57,843 --> 02:44:00,011
Why don't you come with me?

2032
02:44:00,179 --> 02:44:01,948
Get into some trouble.

2033
02:44:01,972 --> 02:44:04,409
Knock off some
CEO hedge fund types.

2034
02:44:04,433 --> 02:44:06,620
It'll be fun.

2035
02:44:06,644 --> 02:44:08,896
The bat and the cat.

2036
02:44:09,730 --> 02:44:12,191
It's got a nice ring.

2037
02:44:24,870 --> 02:44:26,872
Who am I kidding?

2038
02:44:27,498 --> 02:44:30,501
You're already spoken for.

2039
02:44:41,762 --> 02:44:43,722
You should go.

2040
02:44:51,689 --> 02:44:53,148
Selina...

2041
02:44:56,443 --> 02:44:58,904
Take care of yourself.
